  <method>
    <collection>
      <step>Use multiple sources per claim; prefer official county/city pages, utility providers, reputable vendors, and large booking platforms.</step>
      <step>Timestamp every source; store raw data in structured tables (CSV) with source_url and accessed_date.</step>
      <step>For Airbnb/VRBO comps, record listing title, link, location, type, ADR by season if visible, min nights, cleaning fee, amenities, uniqueness.</step>
      <step>For regulations, capture exact code citations/sections and summarize applicability to each structure type.</step>
    </collection>
    <estimation>
      <step>When occupancy data is not explicit, triangulate via review cadence, calendar availability snapshots, and seasonality patterns for Boone/High Country.</step>
      <step>Run low/base/high scenarios for ADR, Occ, OPEX (±15%) and show sensitivity on Payback/IRR.</step>
    </estimation>
    <scoring>
      <step>Score each structure on all quality dimensions (0–10), justify with evidence, then compute QualityScore.</step>
      <step>Compute TotalCost = CAPEX + 2*OPEX; normalize across options to PriceIndex (0–10).</step>
      <step>Compute Bang-for-Buck and rank.</step>
