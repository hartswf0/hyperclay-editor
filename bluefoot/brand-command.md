Perfect — let’s treat **Blue Foot** not just as a consulting-style output, but as a **brand command system**. I’ll expand the identity, heuristics, and interaction grammar so every site/presentation/report you generate under this label feels consistent, professional, and *distinctively yours*.

---

# 🪽 Blue Foot Brand Command System

## 1. Core Identity

* **Name:** Blue Foot
* **Symbol:** A footprint / track in orbital blue (#2B4D82) — connoting grounded presence + analytical trail.
* **Voice:** Spartan, surgical, almost forensic. Every word feels earned, like a McKinsey bullet distilled *after* a 60-page appendix.
* **Mood:** Calm authority with a mountain-ops vibe. Less “startup pitch,” more “command deck briefing.”

---

## 2. Design Aesthetic

* **Palette:**

  * Parchment (#F7F3EC) = field report paper
  * Granite (#5A5A5A) = analytical backbone
  * Orbital Blue (#2B4D82) = Blue Foot signature
  * Maple Red (#C32F27) = action flag / risks
  * Safety Yellow (#FFD447) = warnings / notes
  * Ink Black (#0E0E10) = text baseline

* **Typography:**

  * Headings = clean system sans-serif, weight 600, uppercase spacing
  * Body = system sans-serif, weight 400, 1.5× line-height
  * Numbers = monospace for gravity (ratios, ADRs, reviews, CAPEX line items)

* **Gestures:**

  * Thin gridlines, subtle drop-shadows
  * Clear carding of info (each comp as a “data card” not a raw row)
  * Chips & badges for signals (Guest Favorite, Hot Tub, New Listing)

## 3. Interaction Grammar

Every Blue Foot product should include:

1. **Header Strip**: Title + timestamp + context line.
2. **Executive 3-Tile KPI row**: Fast “read the room” metrics.
3. **Deep Table / Cards**: The comps, data, or scenarios in a format that’s filterable, sortable, and scannable.
4. **Insight Panel**: Bulleted interpretation. Blue Foot doesn’t dump data — it *reads the data back to you*.
5. **Method Note**: Always include “how to read this” caveats (date-sensitive, indicative, etc.).
6. **Export Strip**: CSV, Print/PDF, or Screenshot-ready.

## 4. Brand Phrasing (microcopy)

* **Header:** “Blue Foot — [Topic] Report”
* **Subtitle:** “Public scan / indicative only / timestamped for field use.”
* **Badges:** short, lowercase, tactile (e.g., `guest favorite`, `new listing`, `hot tub`)
* **Insights:** Always verb-first:

  * “Premium domes cluster at $185–$259 ADR.”
  * “Butler/Watauga has active glamp comps.”
  * “Tiny house ADR range shows demand resilience.”

---

## 5. Command Heuristics

When building a Blue Foot site or deck:

* **Less is more:** no dense paragraphs; always compress to bullet or tile.
* **Show ratios:** guest favorite % share, ADR min–max, review volume distribution.
* **Thresholds:** flag “minimum to qualify as X” (e.g., minimum viable glamping).
* **Comparatives:** always show cost/quality delta across types.

---

## 6. Deployable Templates

* **Comps Table Mode:** for market scan, STR analysis, pricing headroom.
* **CAPEX Breakdown Mode:** for structure type comparisons, with kit links & cost drivers.
* **Policy/Permit Mode:** summarizing regs, taxes, compliance gates.
* **Payoff Matrix Mode:** bang-for-buck scatter or quality/cost payoff grid.

👉 Next step: I can **bake these brand rules directly into a reusable HTML skeleton** so every Blue Foot analysis you spin up already has the palette, header strip, KPI row, table/card system, insight panel, and export tools. Then you just drop in the dataset (comps, CAPEX, policies) and the site self-assembles.

Do you want me to build that **“Blue Foot Analysis Template”** now as a one-file HTML/CSS/JS you can re-use?
