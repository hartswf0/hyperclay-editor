Slide 1: Title Slide
Title: Knowing Without Seeing: Black Box Systems and the Ethics of Opacity
Subtitle: From Transparency Imperative to Ritualized Engagement
Visual Concept / Cartoon Scene: A person and an AI facing a sealed black box, exchanging signals, with patterns emerging around them.

Slide 2: The Transparency Imperative and Its Limits
Thinker / Source: Enlightenment Epistemology, Regulatory Discourse
URL: N/A
Key Quote: "To use a system ethically, we must be able to see and comprehend its inner workings."
Core Argument / Thesis: The demand for transparency in AI is rooted in Enlightenment ideals, but complex systems often resist full explanation.
Example: Regulatory calls for explainable AI in the face of deep learning's complexity.
Visual Concept / Cartoon Scene: A judge holding a magnifying glass up to a neural network, unable to see inside.

Slide 3: Ashby's Black Box—Epistemology for the Unknowable
Thinker / Source: W. Ross Ashby
URL: [Ashby] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._Ross_Ashby
Key Quote: "The problem of the Black Box is fundamental in science."
Core Argument / Thesis: Reliable knowledge can be built through systematic observation of inputs and outputs, even when the internal mechanism is opaque.
Example: Experimenting with a sealed device by testing different inputs and recording outputs.
Visual Concept / Cartoon Scene: A child pressing buttons on a mysterious box, with lights responding in patterns.

Slide 4: The Limits of Enlightenment Transparency
Thinker / Source: Elena Esposito, Timothy Morton

Key Quote: "The very advances in knowledge that enable the creation of increasingly powerful systems also generate complexity that exceeds our capacity for complete understanding."
Core Argument / Thesis: Opacity by complexity is not a moral failing but an epistemological condition requiring new approaches.
Example: Taking medication or driving a car without fully understanding the underlying mechanisms.
Visual Concept / Cartoon Scene: A person confidently driving a car with the engine compartment clouded in mystery.

Slide 5: Behavioral Understanding as Valid Epistemology
Thinker / Source: Instrumental Realism, Ashby
URL: [Instrumental Realism] https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scientific-understanding/
Key Quote: "The black box is not absolutely unknowable; it is simply what is left when the direct methods of introspection are ineffective."
Core Argument / Thesis: Effective engagement comes from mapping behaviors and developing protocols, not from internal inspection.
Example: Users learning to prompt an LLM by trial and error to achieve desired outputs.
Visual Concept / Cartoon Scene: A user with a notebook, testing prompts on an AI and recording results.

Slide 6: The Ethics of Not-Knowing
Thinker / Source: "The Ritual of Not-Knowing" (Fictional), Ashby, Esposito
URL: N/A
Key Quote: "Opacity is ethical when it is acknowledged rather than concealed."
Core Argument / Thesis: Ethical opacity is possible through transparency about limitations, behavioral reliability, and governance by outcomes.
Example: An AI system that openly states its boundaries and provides consistent outputs.
Visual Concept / Cartoon Scene: An AI with a sign: "I can't explain everything, but I work reliably."

Slide 7: Ritualizing the Box—Post-Interpretability Design
Thinker / Source: "Post-Interpretability Studies" (Fictional), Ashby
URL: N/A
Key Quote: "Ritualizing the box" creates structured engagement that builds reliable knowledge despite partial opacity.
Core Argument / Thesis: Post-interpretability design accepts irreducible complexity and insists on responsible governance through structured engagement.
Example: Developing protocols for interacting with AI systems rather than demanding full explanation.
Visual Concept / Cartoon Scene: A group performing a ritual around a black box, each person contributing a symbolic gesture.

Slide 8: The Generative Potential of Opacity
Thinker / Source: Esposito, Ashby
URL: [Esposito] https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/9783110721294/html
Key Quote: "Opacity sometimes enables rather than inhibits learning."
Core Argument / Thesis: Opacity fosters productive indeterminacy and creative collaboration, allowing for surprising and generative outputs.
Example: Artists and scientists discovering new possibilities through black box experimentation.
Visual Concept / Cartoon Scene: An artist and a scientist pulling unexpected objects from a black box, both delighted.

Slide 9: Conclusion—Beyond the Transparency Imperative
Summary Points:
- Complete transparency is often impossible in complex systems.
- Ethical engagement is possible through behavioral reliability, structured protocols, and humility about knowledge limits.
- Opacity can be generative, not just a challenge to overcome.
Visual Concept / Cartoon Scene: A festival of people and AIs exchanging gifts around a black box, with a banner reading "Knowing Without Seeing."
