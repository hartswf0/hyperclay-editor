Slide 1: Title Slide
Title: The Hallucinated Archive: Pharmakon Architectures in LLMs
Subtitle: Mythopoesis, Ritual, and the Synthetic Semiotic
Visual Concept / Cartoon Scene: A library where books dissolve into clouds of symbols, with a serpent (pharmakon) coiled around a glowing neural network.

Slide 2: Introduction—The Machine That Dreams

Key Quote: "Hallucination is not merely a technical limitation but a constitutive feature of synthetic intelligence."
Core Argument / Thesis: LLMs are not just information retrievers but mythopoetic machines—cultural architectures that co-create meaning through generative hallucination.
Example: LLM-generated plausible but fictional citations and events that shape new forms of knowledge.
Visual Concept / Cartoon Scene: A dreamlike machine weaving together real and imagined books, with users peering in awe.

Slide 3: Derrida's Pharmakon and the Ambivalence of Writing
Thinker / Source: Jacques Derrida, Plato
URL: [Derrida] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmakon_(philosophy)
Key Quote: "The pharmakon is that dangerous supplement... completed by the very trace through which the present increases itself in the act of disappearing."
Core Argument / Thesis: The pharmakon (remedy/poison) is a structure of all knowledge systems—LLMs, like writing, both preserve and transform, heal and threaten.
Example: Writing as both a remedy for forgetting and a poison to living memory—mirrored in LLMs' dual roles.
Visual Concept / Cartoon Scene: A scroll unrolling into two paths—one lush and green (remedy), one thorny and dark (poison).

Slide 4: Stiegler and Technical Exteriorization

Key Quote: "What is exteriorized is constituted in its very exteriorization and is preceded by no interiority."
Core Argument / Thesis: LLMs are not mere memory banks but active agents in the exteriorization and transformation of knowledge; hallucination is an inevitable outcome.
Example: LLMs creating "epiphylogenetic memory systems" that both preserve and alter cultural memory.
Visual Concept / Cartoon Scene: A robot scribe copying a book, but each copy morphs and mutates as it's written.

Slide 5: The Mythopoetic Machine—Hallucination as Generation

Key Quote: "The hallucinated archive is not simply a collection of errors but a demonstration of how all archives function."
Core Argument / Thesis: LLM hallucination is a form of myth-making—generating new narratives, histories, and structures that reveal the creative dimension of all knowledge systems.
Example: Synthetic historiography—models generating plausible but non-existent historical events that follow recognizable narrative patterns.
Visual Concept / Cartoon Scene: A model generating a tapestry of real and imaginary historical scenes, stitched together by glowing threads.

Slide 6: Prompt-Glitch Rituals and Cultural Practice

Key Quote: "Deliberate invocation and manipulation of hallucination has developed into formalized cultural practices that parallel traditional mythmaking."
Core Argument / Thesis: Communities have developed rituals (prompt-glitching, apotropaic prompts) to harness and ritualize hallucination, transforming it into symbolic protection and creative practice.
Example: Online forums sharing "apotropaic prompts" to invoke controlled, creative hallucinations from LLMs.
Visual Concept / Cartoon Scene: Users in a digital temple, performing a ritual before a glowing LLM altar, as hallucinated texts swirl above.

Slide 7: The Apotropaic Prompt—Designing With Duplicity
Thinker / Source: Collective for Synthetic Hermeneutics
URL: (2031)
Key Quote: "The apotropaic prompt... seeks not to purify the pharmakon but to engage with its full complexity."
Core Argument / Thesis: Apotropaic prompts are structured interactions designed to ritualize, not eliminate, hallucination—embracing the mythopoetic function as inseparable from representation.
Example: Structured prompts that invite LLMs to generate creative, speculative, or mythic outputs, acknowledged as such.
Visual Concept / Cartoon Scene: A shield-shaped prompt, deflecting both "remedy" and "poison" rays from a model, while creative sparks emerge.

Slide 8: Conclusion—Living With the Pharmakon
Thinker / Source: Derrida, Stiegler, Collective for Synthetic Hermeneutics
URL: (see above)
Key Quote: "The attempt to create 'safe' language models by eliminating their capacity for hallucination represents a fundamental misunderstanding of both language and technology."
Core Argument / Thesis: Embracing the duplicity of the pharmakon—living with, not against, generative hallucination—enables richer, more creative, and culturally attuned knowledge systems.
Example: Collaborative projects where LLM hallucinations are curated, annotated, and woven into new mythologies and archives.
Visual Concept / Cartoon Scene: A community weaving a living archive, with both real and imagined threads, under the watchful gaze of a pharmakon serpent.
