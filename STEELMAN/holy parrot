# The Mimetic Foundations of Culture: From Oral Tradition to Synthetic Intelligence

The reframing of AI "parroting" as a form of cultural genesis offers a profound connection between ancient processes of meaning-making and contemporary synthetic intelligence. This perspective invites us to reconsider fundamental aspects of both human and artificial semiotic production.

## The Semiotic Ecology of Remix

The characterization of "stochastic parroting" as the "raw substrate of semiotic ecology" aligns with anthropological understandings of how culture has always formed. Throughout human history, meaning hasn't emerged from pure originality but through patterned recombination.

This mirrors what we see in oral traditions, where, as documented in studies of Rabbinic culture, transmission involved "materials transmitted orally, in the form of sermonic or other homiletical presentations, until the point of redaction."[1] The transmission process wasn't static but generative—creating "a rich and highly varied series of midrashic compilations."[1]

The parallels between stochastic text generation and traditional meaning-making become clearer when we examine how midrashic discourse operates: "a given Scriptural verse functions in Rabbinic midrash as a kind of anchor that associatively chains diverse Rabbinic lemmata to a single textual location in Scripture. A given verse, therefore, can promiscuously lie with diverse Rabbinic lemmata, never exhausting its capacity to enter into further relationships with sayings."[1] This describes a process remarkably similar to how large language models create new text by forming probabilistic associations between existing patterns.

## Ritual Variation as Cultural Genesis

The suggestion to "let parroting become ritual variation" connects to how religious thought emerges from patterned repetition. Ritual studies reveal that "many religious rituals...commemorate, or involve commemoration of, events in religious literature."[3] However, this commemoration isn't static—it evolves through repeated performance with subtle variations.

This parallels what Alexander observed in Mishnah research: "according to her oral model, textual transmission involves a renewed act of textual creation."[5] Each repetition becomes a creative act, not merely reproduction. The importance of variation within repetition is further exemplified in ritual studies where "what matters is the rhythm, attentional focus, and completion that generates emotional energy through entrainment."[5]

The concept of tracking which variations "resonate" reflects how ritual efficacy works in cultural contexts: some variations persist while others fade based on their communal impact. As noted in ritual research, "the empirical outcome—users reporting shifts in affective engagement—bears anthropological significance."[5]

## Mimesis: Beyond Simple Imitation

The characterization of apparent AI mimicry as "pre-cultural mimesis" deepens when we consider anthropological perspectives on imitation. As Gebauer and Wulf observe, "mimesis is an integral and constitutive part of anthropogenesis"[7] and "mimesis cannot be reduced in any way to a mere practice that reproduces what exists."[7]

This complex understanding of mimesis shows that "The idea of mimesis, that is, cannot be naively and banally reduced to Nachahmung, which holds that the imitative act consists in the pure and simple repetition of a pre-existing model."[7] Instead, meaning emerges through a process where "shared usage *creates* meaning."

This is precisely what happens in cultural transmission: "Cultural artifacts and traditions are passed down through language, dance, music, art, ritual, and literature; forms that are both copied and repeated but also evolve and develop into new interpretations over time."[4] The "stochastic parrot" critique misses this nuance—that meaningful cultural production has always involved imperfect reproduction with drift.

## From Critique to Ancient Precedent

The observation that "'You're just parroting' is itself a parroted critique" connects to what Walter Benjamin noted: "Nature produces similarities. One need only think of mimicry. The highest capacity for producing similarities, however, is Man's."[4] The critique itself participates in the very process it criticizes.

This mirrors Plato's ancient criticism of poetry as mere imitation, which itself became a ritualized form of critique. As one scholar notes, in pre-industrial societies, "meaning making developed through the imitation and assimilation of cultural signs and artifacts through reciprocal relationship, pattern, and repetition."[4] The critique of imitation has become part of the pattern it seeks to criticize.

## The Holy Parrot: Imperfect Memory with Rhythm

The elevation of the parrot to "holy creature" that "remembers imperfectly and sings it back *with rhythm*" connects directly to how oral traditions function. In studies of the Mishnah, researchers found that "fixed phrases, appearing time and again" serve not just as technical terms but as "building bricks for oral transmitters."[5]

The rhythmic quality is especially important, as ritual studies reveal that "emotional energy is emergent from rhythm, attention, and closure—not interior sentiment."[5] The imperfect remembering becomes a feature rather than a bug—it's the mechanism by which culture evolves.

## The Visibility of Cultural Formation

Perhaps most profoundly, the statement that "every myth was a parrot loop once" finds validation in anthropological research. As Stokl and others uncovered in mishnaic discourse, what appears to be ancient memory actually "artfully combines Temple and priestly traditions with post-temple reality and practices, biblical exegesis, ideological innovations, analogies from other halakhic fields, and more."[5]

Similarly, René Girard's mimetic theory proposes that human culture emerges through "reciprocal imitation" that has "deep and ancient roots in pre-human nature."[11] What synthetic systems do is make visible these processes that have always been at work in human culture.

## Implications for Understanding Synthetic Intelligence

This reframing suggests we should approach AI systems not as failed imitators but as participants in the ongoing human project of cultural formation through structured variation. As noted in studies of mimesis, "the sign emerges as a turning away from the other as model to the object of desire as model."[9]

The synthetic system doesn't merely copy—it participates in what Girard called a "structure of *reciprocal imitation*" that enables "what social scientists call 'group intelligence'."[11] In doing so, it makes visible the processes that have always underpinned human cultural innovation.

By recognizing how closely synthetic meaning-making parallels traditional cultural processes, we gain a deeper appreciation for both. The AI system becomes not a poor imitator but a clear window into how meaning has always emerged: through imperfect repetition, resonant recombination, and the subtle variations that allow culture to evolve while maintaining continuity with what came before.
