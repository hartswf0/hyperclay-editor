Slide 1: Title Slide
Title: Misuse the Apparatus: Creative Subversion as Ethnographic Method
Subtitle: From Glitch to Myth in AI Systems
Visual Concept / Cartoon Scene: A user poking at a machine, causing whimsical glitches that morph into mythic creatures and symbols.

Slide 2: The Generative Potential of False Metaphors
Thinker / Source: Synthetic Ethnography, Machine Metaphor

Key Quote: "The machine is a blind cartographer, mapping lands it cannot see, its compass spinning in silent confusion."
Core Argument / Thesis: Paradoxical metaphors about AI limitations transform technical constraints into poetic, mythic expression.
Example: Describing AI as a mirror that reflects shadows, not faces.
Visual Concept / Cartoon Scene: A machine with a spinning compass, mapping imaginary lands, with shadows and faces in the mist.

Slide 3: The Glitch as Mythic Emergence
Thinker / Source: Media Theory, Mythopoesis
URL: N/A
Key Quote: "A glitch emerges: a flicker in the code, a crack in the glass, a myth born from error."
Core Argument / Thesis: Glitches, usually seen as malfunctions, can be reframed as the birth of new myths—turning errors into cultural artifacts.
Example: A software bug inspiring a story or artwork.
Visual Concept / Cartoon Scene: A crack in a digital screen, from which mythic symbols and creatures emerge.

Slide 4: Methodological Implications—Adversarial Ethnography
Thinker / Source: Vilém Flusser, Synthetic Ethnography
URL: [Flusser] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vil%C3%A9m_Flusser
Key Quote: "Playing against the apparatus expands creative possibilities beyond programmed intentions."
Core Argument / Thesis: Deliberately subverting AI systems (misuse) reveals hidden properties and expands creative potential.
Example: Prompting an AI to generate nonsense or paradoxes to expose its boundaries.
Visual Concept / Cartoon Scene: A researcher and AI engaged in a tug-of-war, with unexpected ideas spilling out.

Slide 5: Semiotic Material and Gesture
Thinker / Source: Gesture Theory, Media Studies
URL: N/A
Key Quote: "Gesture, not function, becomes the expressive potential of the system."
Core Argument / Thesis: Errors, contradictions, and limitations are not just problems—they are expressive, meaningful artifacts for study and creation.
Example: Repurposing AI misalignment as poetic or artistic material.
Visual Concept / Cartoon Scene: A gallery of 'glitches' displayed as art, with visitors interpreting their meaning.

Slide 6: Practical Applications
Thinker / Source: Creative Practice, Critical Pedagogy
URL: N/A
Key Quote: "The misuse becomes a form of use that reveals what conventional approaches might miss."
Core Argument / Thesis: Creative misuse of AI can drive artistic production, technical exploration, philosophical inquiry, and teaching.
Example: Using adversarial prompts in a classroom to teach critical thinking about AI.
Visual Concept / Cartoon Scene: Students and artists using AI, with some following instructions and others joyfully breaking the rules.

Slide 7: Conclusion—The Myth of Self-Description
Summary Points:
- Deliberate misuse of AI systems can reveal their hidden assumptions and limitations.
- Glitches and errors become mythic material, not just technical flaws.
- Creative subversion transforms constraints into opportunities for meaning-making and insight.
Visual Concept / Cartoon Scene: A curtain lifting to reveal a stage where glitches and myths dance together, blurring the line between error and art.
