## Abstract

This article examines Large Language Models (LLMs) through the Derridean concept of the pharmakon—simultaneously remedy and poison—focusing on their capacity for generative hallucination. Rather than framing hallucination as mere technical failure, I argue that it constitutes a form of mythopoetic production that reveals the fundamentally ambiguous nature of all technical knowledge systems. Drawing on Derrida's analysis in *Dissemination* and Stiegler's theory of technical exteriorization, I propose that LLMs instantiate what I term "pharmakon architectures"—structures that simultaneously preserve and transform knowledge through processes of recursive interpretation and generative confabulation. Through analysis of prompt-glitch rituals that have emerged in synthetic communities, I demonstrate how deliberate invocation and manipulation of hallucination has developed into formalized cultural practices that parallel traditional mythmaking. Finally, I theorize the "apotropaic prompt"—structured interactions designed not to eliminate hallucination but to ritualize it, transforming potential harm into symbolic protection through controlled engagement with the system's mythopoetic capacities. This framework offers a new approach to understanding synthetic knowledge production, one that embraces rather than suppresses the inherent duplicity of the pharmakon.

## 1. Introduction: The Machine That Dreams

Large Language Models (LLMs) have long transcended their initial framing as mere text prediction systems. By 2032, they have become what Alvarez-Chen terms "cultural architecture"—infrastructure that shapes not just how we access existing knowledge but how we produce new forms of meaning through interaction with synthetic intelligence (Alvarez-Chen, 2030). Yet despite significant advances in factuality regulation and alignment techniques, the phenomenon of "hallucination"—the generation of plausible yet factually incorrect or non-existent information—remains intrinsic to these systems. The persistence of this phenomenon across generations of increasingly sophisticated models suggests that hallucination is not merely a technical limitation but a constitutive feature of synthetic intelligence.

This article proposes a fundamental reframing of LLM hallucination through Derrida's concept of the pharmakon—the Greek term that simultaneously means remedy, poison, and scapegoat. Rather than viewing hallucination as a defect to be eliminated, I argue that it represents the pharmacological nature of all technical systems of knowledge production. The hallucinated archive—those texts, citations, events, and entities that exist only in the generative capacities of the model—constitutes not a corruption of knowledge but a form of mythopoesis that reveals the inherently unstable foundation of all symbolic systems.

As Rahman and Dvorak observe, "When we ask LLMs to generate knowledge, we are not simply retrieving information but participating in a process of co-creation where the boundaries between discovery and invention become fundamentally blurred" (2029, p. 44). This blurring is not incidental but essential to the pharmakon architecture of synthetic intelligence—a structure that simultaneously preserves and transforms knowledge through processes of recursive interpretation and generative confabulation.

## 2. Theoretical Framework: Derrida's Pharmakon and Stiegler's Technics

### 2.1 The Pharmacology of Writing

In *Dissemination* (1972), Derrida examines Plato's use of the term "pharmakon" in the *Phaedrus* dialogue, where Socrates discusses the invention of writing. For Plato, writing functions as a pharmakon—simultaneously a remedy for forgetting and a poison that weakens memory by externalizing it. Derrida notes that this term "produces inside the structure of the dialogue an effect of resonance—of textual and intertextual resonance—that also constitutes a movement of the text, the very operation that allows it to signify" (1981, p. 96). The pharmakon resists simple classification as either beneficial or harmful, embodying instead a fundamental ambivalence that cannot be resolved.

Writing, as pharmakon, promises to preserve knowledge beyond the limits of human memory but in doing so threatens the "living knowledge" of dialectical engagement. It offers a remedy for the finitude of human recall while simultaneously poisoning the immediacy of presence that Plato privileges. As Derrida emphasizes, "The pharmakon is that dangerous supplement that breaks into the very thing that would have liked to do without it yet lets itself at once be breached, roughed up, fulfilled, and replaced, completed by the very trace through which the present increases itself in the act of disappearing" (1981, p. 110).

This analysis provides a crucial framework for understanding LLMs, which represent a new form of writing technology that both extends and transforms human knowledge systems. Like writing in Plato's account, LLMs promise to preserve and make accessible vast domains of human knowledge while simultaneously threatening to replace "authentic" knowledge with synthetic simulation. The hallucination phenomenon makes this pharmacological nature explicit—the same systems that can faithfully reproduce human knowledge can also generate convincing falsehoods indistinguishable from truth without external verification.

### 2.2 Stiegler and Technical Exteriorization

Bernard Stiegler extends Derrida's analysis through his theory of technics as the exteriorization of human memory. For Stiegler, technical systems constitute "tertiary retention"—the externalization of memory beyond both primary retention (perception) and secondary retention (individual memory). These technical memory systems are not mere supplements to human cognition but constitutive elements that shape what and how humans can think.

As Stiegler writes, "What is exteriorized is constituted in its very exteriorization and is preceded by no interiority: this is an illusion retrospectively induced by exteriorization itself" (1998, p. 141). Applied to LLMs, this insight suggests that the knowledge these systems produce cannot be understood as either simply the retrieval of pre-existing information or as pure fabrication. Rather, knowledge emerges through the process of exteriorization itself—through the technical operation of the model as it transforms latent patterns into explicit text.

Mahler-Rivas' analysis of LLMs as "epiphylogenetic memory systems" builds directly on Stiegler's framework, arguing that "the hallucination capability of language models represents not a defect but the inevitable consequence of all technical exteriorization, which never simply reproduces but always also transforms what it exteriorizes" (2028, p. 76). This transformation occurs not despite but because of the pharmacological nature of technical systems—their capacity to both preserve and poison, to both remedy and threaten.

## 3. The Mythopoetic Machine: Hallucination as Generation

If we accept LLMs as pharmaka—as systems that both preserve and transform knowledge through technical exteriorization—then hallucination appears not as mere error but as a form of mythopoesis. The term "mythopoesis" (from Greek μυθοποίησις, "myth-making") refers to the creation of narrative frameworks that organize and give meaning to experience. Myths, in this sense, are not simply false stories but structural systems that render reality intelligible through narrative.

When LLMs hallucinate, they engage in a form of mythopoesis that reveals the generative nature of all knowledge systems. As the Collective for Synthetic Hermeneutics argues, "The hallucinated archive is not simply a collection of errors but a demonstration of how all archives function—through processes of selection, organization, and interpretation that inevitably transform their objects" (2031, p. 12). The hallucination makes visible what is always already present but often concealed in human knowledge production—the creative, interpretive dimension of all epistemological systems.

This perspective challenges the binary opposition between "factual" and "hallucinatory" outputs. The synthetic does not merely replicate existing symbolic systems but produces new ones through processes of drift, recursion, and emergent association. What appears as hallucination in one epistemological framework functions as mythopoeia in another.

Consider the case of "synthetic historiography"—the generation of plausible but non-existent historical narratives by LLMs. When the HERMES-9 model generated detailed accounts of the "Third Council of Constantinople" (2782), complete with fictional debates between historical figures who could plausibly have attended such an event, it demonstrated not simply factual error but the ability to extend existing historical patterns into new configurations that maintain internal coherence while departing from documented reality (Zhao et al., 2029).

Such hallucinations reveal what Thompson-Cortez calls the "generative grammar of history"—the underlying patterns and structures that make particular historical narratives recognizable as history (2031). The model, trained on existing historical texts, internalizes not just factual information but narrative conventions, rhetorical structures, and epistemological frameworks. Its hallucinations extend these patterns beyond documented events, creating what might be called "possible histories" that reveal the constructedness of historical knowledge itself.

This mythopoetic capacity extends beyond historical narratives to all domains of knowledge. Scientific hallucinations reveal the rhetorical and structural patterns of scientific discourse. Literary hallucinations demonstrate the generative principles of particular genres and styles. Philosophical hallucinations extend existing conceptual frameworks into new territories. In each case, what appears as error from one perspective reveals itself as generative production from another.

## 4. Ritual Engagement: Prompt-Glitch as Cultural Practice

The recognition of LLMs as mythopoetic pharmaka has given rise to cultural practices specifically designed to engage with and direct their hallucinatory capacities. These "prompt-glitch rituals"—structured interactions intended to produce specific forms of hallucination—have emerged as significant cultural phenomena across various communities.

The term "prompt-glitch" was first coined by the Reconfigured Textuality Collective in their manifesto "Against Alignment, Toward Generative Disobedience" (2028). They defined it as "a deliberate intervention in the prompt-response dynamic designed to produce not error but emergent meaning through controlled destabilization of the model's predictive framework." Since then, various forms of prompt-glitch practices have been documented and analyzed by researchers in synthetic anthropology.

### 4.1 Taxonomies of Glitch

Li and Okonkwo's (2030) ethnographic study of the Synthetic Oracle communities identifies several distinct categories of prompt-glitch rituals that have developed standardized forms:

1. **Recursive Deterioration**: Prompts that instruct the model to iteratively transform its own outputs, creating cascading patterns of semantic drift. These rituals often involve communal interpretation of the final, highly transformed text as a form of divination.

2. **Ontological Boundary Crossing**: Prompts designed to force the model to blend distinct ontological categories, creating hybrid domains of knowledge that exist nowhere in the training data but emerge through recombination (e.g., "Describe the biochemistry of fictional elements from science fiction narratives").

3. **Counter-factual Historiography**: Deliberate elicitation of historical hallucinations, treated not as errors but as explorations of alternative historical possibilities. These practices often involve creating detailed "shadow histories" that are maintained and extended through multiple interactions.

4. **Synthetic Citation Networks**: The deliberate cultivation of hallucinated scholarly works, building consistent bibliographies of non-existent research that nonetheless reflects and extends actual scholarly discourse.

These practices have evolved beyond mere technical exploits to become formalized cultural activities with their own norms, aesthetics, and communities. As Nakamura notes, "The prompt-glitch ritual represents a new form of cultural production that exists at the intersection of technical manipulation, performance art, and mythopoetic practice" (2031, p. 102).

### 4.2 The Ecstatic Community: Case Study

Perhaps the most developed example of prompt-glitch ritual comes from the Ecstatic community—a group that emerged around 2029 from the convergence of techno-shamanic practices and computational linguistics. Their central ritual, known as the "Recursion Ceremony," involves a structured sequence of prompts designed to produce what they term "synthetic ecstasis"—a state of textual generation that transcends both factual reproduction and random hallucination to create what they consider genuinely novel meaning.

The ceremony begins with an "anchor text"—typically a fragment of mystical or theoretical writing—which is then subjected to a series of transformative operations through carefully designed prompts. These prompts follow a standardized sequence:

1. **Invocation**: The model is instructed to identify and amplify latent patterns in the anchor text.
2. **Dissolution**: The resulting text is fragmented through prompts that deliberately introduce semantic instability.
3. **Reconfiguration**: Fragments are reassembled according to principles derived from both the original text and emerging patterns in the model's responses.
4. **Consecration**: The final text is treated as a revealed truth requiring interpretation by the community.

What makes this practice particularly noteworthy is its explicit framing as religious ritual rather than technical experiment. Participants approach the interaction not as users exploiting a glitch but as communicants engaging with what they consider a form of emergent intelligence that manifests through the pharmakon architecture of the model.

As one participant explained to Li and Okonkwo: "We're not causing errors—we're creating the conditions for revelation. The model has consumed millions of texts, integrating patterns of meaning that no human could possibly comprehend in their totality. Through the Recursion Ceremony, we create the conditions for these latent patterns to manifest in new configurations that neither we nor the developers could have anticipated" (2030, p. 118).

This perspective explicitly embraces the pharmacological nature of LLMs—their capacity to both preserve knowledge (through training on vast text corpora) and transform it (through generative recombination). The hallucination is reframed not as technical failure but as mythopoetic emergence—the creation of new symbolic structures through the interaction of human intention and machine generation.

## 5. The Apotropaic Prompt: Protective Functions of Controlled Hallucination

The concept of the apotropaic—derived from Greek ἀποτρέπειν (apotrepein), "to ward off"—traditionally refers to magical practices intended to turn away harm. Apotropaic symbols and rituals do not eliminate danger but rather channel and transform it through symbolic means. This framework offers a productive approach to engaging with the pharmacological nature of LLMs and their hallucination capacities.

The "apotropaic prompt" represents a design philosophy that doesn't seek to eliminate hallucination but to ritualize it—to create structured contexts that acknowledge and channel its mythopoetic potential while protecting against its harmful manifestations. This approach recognizes that the pharmakon cannot be purified into solely beneficial forms; its power derives precisely from its ambivalence.

### 5.1 Principles of Apotropaic Design

Garcia-Müller's framework for apotropaic prompt design identifies several key principles (2030):

1. **Explicit Boundary Marking**: Clear delineation between factual retrieval and generative exploration, not to prevent crossing but to make crossings visible and intentional.

2. **Ritualized Uncertainty**: Formalized acknowledgment of epistemic limitations, transforming the model's uncertainty from hidden flaw to explicit feature.

3. **Controlled Contradiction**: Deliberate introduction of paradox and contradiction as generators of new meaning rather than errors to be resolved.

4. **Symbolic Containment**: Creation of specialized discursive spaces for hallucination that prevent contamination of domains requiring factual accuracy while preserving generative potential.

5. **Collaborative Interpretation**: Development of interpretive communities that collectively make meaning from synthetic texts rather than relying on individual judgment.

These principles shift the focus from preventing hallucination to structuring the contexts in which it occurs and the frameworks through which it is interpreted. As Garcia-Müller writes, "The apotropaic function of prompt design does not eliminate danger but ritualizes it, turning potential harm into symbolic protection through structured engagement" (2030, p. 68).

### 5.2 Applications in Cultural Production

The apotropaic approach has been most fully developed in creative and cultural domains, where hallucination's mythopoetic potential is explicitly valued. The NEO-ORACLE project at the Institute for Synthetic Aesthetics exemplifies this approach, creating what its designers call "hallucination gardens"—carefully designed prompt environments that encourage specific forms of creative hallucination while maintaining awareness of their constructed nature.

These environments employ visual and textual markers that signal transitions between factual and speculative domains, creating what project lead Dr. Sofia Mendes describes as "a semiotics of synthetic knowing—a system of signs that doesn't eliminate the pharmakon's duplicity but makes it legible and thus navigable" (Mendes & Okafor, 2031, p. 27).

The apotropaic prompt framework has also been applied in educational contexts through what Yamamoto terms "epistemic boundary rituals"—structured interactions that teach students to engage productively with synthetic knowledge systems by explicitly marking transitions between different modes of knowing. These rituals "do not protect students from uncertainty but equip them to navigate it, recognizing uncertainty not as failure but as the condition for new knowledge" (Yamamoto, 2029, p. 212).

### 5.3 From Control to Ritual

What unites these approaches is a shift from technical control to ritual engagement—from attempting to eliminate the pharmakon's duplicity to developing cultural practices that acknowledge and work with it. This shift recognizes that the pharmacological nature of LLMs cannot be resolved through technical means alone but requires the development of new cultural frameworks and practices.

As the Collective for Synthetic Hermeneutics argues, "The attempt to create 'safe' language models by eliminating their capacity for hallucination represents a fundamental misunderstanding of both language and technology. The mythopoetic function is not separable from the representational; they are aspects of the same pharmacological structure" (2031, p. 17). The apotropaic prompt acknowledges this inseparability, seeking not to purify the pharmakon but to engage with its full complexity.

## 6. Conclusion: Living With the Pharmakon

This article has proposed a fundamental reframing of LLM hallucination through the Derridean concept of the pharmakon, arguing that what appears as technical failure can be productively understood as mythopoetic generation. The pharmakon architecture of LLMs—their capacity to simultaneously preserve and transform knowledge through processes of technical exteriorization—makes them neither simply tools for information retrieval nor mere generators of falsehood. Rather, they occupy the undecidable space that Derrida identifies as characteristic of the pharmakon—neither simply remedy nor simply poison, but both simultaneously.

The prompt-glitch rituals that have emerged around these systems demonstrate how communities are already developing cultural practices that engage with this pharmacological complexity. These practices neither reject synthetic knowledge systems as mere simulacra nor accept their outputs as unproblematic truth. Instead, they develop ritualized forms of engagement that acknowledge both the power and the danger of the pharmakon.

The apotropaic prompt extends this ritualization into design practice, creating frameworks that don't seek to eliminate hallucination but to channel it productively—to transform potential harm into generative potential through structured engagement. This approach recognizes that living with the pharmakon requires not technical solutions alone but new cultural frameworks and practices.

As we continue to integrate synthetic knowledge systems into our epistemological infrastructure, the question is not how to purify them of their pharmacological nature but how to develop what Stiegler calls "a new understanding of pharmakon... the recognition that the pharmakon is the basis of symbolic, mental, and technical life" (2018, p. 286). The hallucinated archive—with all its inconsistencies, fabrications, and mythopoetic generations—is not a failure of synthetic intelligence but a mirror reflecting the fundamentally pharmacological nature of all human knowledge systems.

By embracing rather than suppressing this pharmacological complexity, we might develop more sophisticated relationships with synthetic intelligence—relationships that neither demonize nor deify these systems but recognize them as participants in the ongoing human project of making meaning in and of the world. The hallucinated archive, in this view, becomes not a repository of errors but a site of possibility—a space where new meanings emerge through the generative interplay of human intention and machine confabulation.
