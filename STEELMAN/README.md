   Format: `Slide X: [Concise Title]`

2. **Subtitle** (optional)  
   A clarifying or contextual subtitle if relevant.

3. **Thinker / Source** (if cited)  
   Name(s) and reference numbers.  
   Example: `Thinker / Source: Vilém Flusser [1, 4]`

4. **URL** (if a source is referenced)  
   Example: `URL: [4] https://lab404.com/3741/readings/flusser.pdf`

5. **Key Quote**  
   A direct quote from the text or cited source that encapsulates the slide’s main point.

6. **Core Argument / Thesis**  
   A concise summary of the main idea, insight, or philosophical claim.

7. **Example**  
   A concrete or illustrative example (from the text, or constructed for clarity).

8. **Visual Concept / Cartoon Scene**  
   Describe a visual, cartoon, or metaphorical scene that would help illustrate the core idea.  
   Be as vivid and specific as possible.
