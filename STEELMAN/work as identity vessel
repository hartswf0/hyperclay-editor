# Work as Identity Vessel: The Ontological Crisis Behind AI Anxiety

The "Gremlin Take" on AI and work presents a profound reframing of our anxieties around automation. Beyond economic concerns lies a deeper ontological question about human identity and meaning in a world where work's traditional role is being fundamentally transformed.

## The Redescription of Work

The claim that jobs are being "redescribed" rather than stolen resonates with emerging research on AI's impact on labor markets. AI isn't simply replacing jobs wholesale but transforming the very nature of work itself. As one study notes, "the most significant advantage of the productivity effect produced by intelligent technology is creation of new demands, that is, the creation of new tasks"[1]. What we're witnessing isn't merely substitution but a fundamental reconfiguration of what constitutes work.

This transformation challenges the traditional "one person, one post" model of employment. The research shows that AI enables "a multiple faceted set of tasks involving one person, many posts, and many types of people"[1]. This "virtual agglomeration" of work represents not just a change in how work is done, but in how we conceptualize work itself.

## Work as Containment Ritual

The characterization of jobs as "containment rituals" that provide identity vessels speaks to the profound psychological function of work beyond economic necessity. This connects directly to what scholars call "ontological security"—a stable sense of self and place in the world. When this security is threatened, we experience what researchers describe as "ontological insecurity," which "occurs when we lose our self-knowledge, become disoriented or feel unbalanced in our everyday sense of self"[8].

The anxiety surrounding AI automation isn't just about lost income but about lost identity. As one researcher notes, identity is "always centrally about sociality: 'Who am I in the world?'"[8]. Work has traditionally provided a powerful answer to this question, and its disruption threatens not just livelihoods but our very sense of being and purpose.

## The Narrative Architecture of Labor

The concern about losing the "narrative architecture of labor" speaks directly to how work structures our understanding of ourselves and society. Current research shows that "The stories we see in the media and in content shared, both online and off, influence how society perceives, interacts with, and ultimately governs an issue area"[3]. Dominant AI narratives currently marginalize workers and "diminish the agency they have over decisions regarding the design, development, and deployment of AI at work"[3].

These narratives typically emphasize productivity, complexity, risk, and innovation—rarely addressing how work shapes our identities and social connections. What's at stake is not just economic displacement but the very frameworks through which we understand human value and purpose.

## Work as Semiotic Theater

The provocative claim that AI reveals work as largely "semiotic theater" finds some support in the research on AI's ability to perform tasks previously thought to require human intelligence. When generative AI can disrupt "more than 30% of all workers" with at least "50% of their occupation's tasks"[10], it raises profound questions about the necessity and value of much human labor.

This realization can be painful because it challenges deeply held beliefs about work's value and necessity. As one researcher notes in examining ontological insecurity, there is "a grounding stability in knowing where one is positioned in relation to other entities or elements of the environment"[8]. Work has provided this positioning function, and its disruption creates a vertiginous feeling of disorientation.

## Emotional and Ontological Functions of Work

The query's suggestion that we examine what work provides "symbolically, emotionally, ontologically" echoes research on the emotional dimensions of human experience. Some scholars are developing "emotional ontology" approaches that recognize how "emotion plays a central role in mediating our social relations and judging situations"[5]. Applied to work, this suggests that employment provides emotional grounding beyond economic security.

Work functions as what some might call a "folk epistemology"—a way of knowing ourselves and our place in the world. As AI disrupts traditional work patterns, it challenges these embedded ways of understanding our purpose and value. The resulting anxiety isn't just about material concerns but about "what gives lives meaningfulness"[8].

## Beyond Economic Validation

Current research suggests we need new narratives around AI and work—ones that center human experience and agency. Experts argue that "for businesses and working people alike to feel the benefits of AI, we need new narratives that center worker voices, narratives that rebalance current power dynamics"[3]. These narratives must address not just economic concerns but the deeper questions of meaning and identity.

Some researchers are already exploring "alternative human-AI narratives suited for the messy—and often unseen—realities of everyday" work[6]. These approaches recognize that we need to reconsider "ways to research these shifts in order to generate the evidence needed to inform networked learning"[6] about how humans and AI can productively co-exist.

## New Possibilities for Meaning

While disruptive, AI's impact on work also opens possibilities for reconsidering what gives human life meaning beyond economic productivity. This mirrors philosophical explorations of identity that recognize how "one is a socially constructed being"[8]. If work has been our primary "containment ritual" for identity, perhaps its disruption allows us to develop more multifaceted and holistic conceptions of human value and purpose.

Some experts suggest that AI could potentially make "work more engaging, inclusive and safer, and to make workers more productive"[4], but only if we approach these transitions with careful consideration of their human impact. The challenge is not just redesigning work processes but reimagining the very purpose and meaning of human activity in an age of increasingly capable AI.

## Conclusion

The "Gremlin Take" on AI and work offers a provocative but insightful perspective on the deeper anxieties surrounding automation. By recognizing work as an "identity vessel" rather than just an economic arrangement, we can better understand the profound disruption AI represents to human self-understanding. The challenge ahead is not just technological or economic but existential: how do we construct meaning and identity in a world where the traditional narratives of work are being fundamentally transformed?

This requires not just policy solutions but philosophical and cultural explorations of human purpose beyond economic productivity. As we navigate this transition, we must ask not just what work we will do, but who we will be—and what will constitute a meaningful human life in the age of artificial intelligence.
