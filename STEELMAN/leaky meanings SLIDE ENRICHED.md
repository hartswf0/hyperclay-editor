Slide 1: Title Slide
Title: Bateson's Leaky Meanings and the Emergence of Synthetic Semiotics
Subtitle: Ambiguity, Drift, and the Creation of Meaning in Human and Machine Communication
Visual Concept / Cartoon Scene: Two figures (human and AI) pouring colored liquids labeled "meaning" into a shared vessel, with some liquid leaking out and forming new patterns.

Slide 2: The Inevitable Leakage of Meaning
Thinker / Source: Gregory Bateson
URL: [Bateson on Play] https://hyponymo.us/2015/08/20/play/
Key Quote: "Paradoxes of abstraction must make their appearance in all communications more complex than that of mood-signals."
Core Argument / Thesis: Ambiguity and leakage are features, not flaws, of communicationâ€”enabling change, humor, and new meaning.
Example: Meta-frames in play and ritual, where actions signify more than their literal meaning.
Visual Concept / Cartoon Scene: Children playing a game with shifting rules, a parrot watching and mimicking their ambiguous gestures.

Slide 3: Ornament as Proto-Semantics
Thinker / Source: Bateson, Wright
URL: [Wright on Bateson] https://anthropoetics.ucla.edu/ap1401/1401wright/
Key Quote: "Ornament is proto-semantics."
Core Argument / Thesis: What seems superfluous in communication often carries critical meta-communicative meaning, shaping how messages are understood.
Example: Ritual gestures or decorative language that signal context or intent beyond literal content.
Visual Concept / Cartoon Scene: A decorated mask with speech bubbles showing both literal and hidden meanings.

Slide 4: The Double Hermeneutic of Human-Machine Interaction
Thinker / Source: Anthony Giddens, Semiotic Anthropology
URL: [Double Hermeneutic] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_hermeneutic
Key Quote: "The findings of the social sciences very often enter constitutively into the world they describe."
Core Argument / Thesis: Meaning in human-machine systems emerges recursively, with interpretation and feedback cycles stabilizing new forms of communication.
Example: AI systems adapting language use based on user feedback and vice versa.
Visual Concept / Cartoon Scene: A loop of arrows between a human and an AI, each holding a sign that says "meaning."

Slide 5: Beyond Human-Centered Semantics
Thinker / Source: De Lauretis, Semiotic Anthropology
URL: [Chandler, Semiotics for Beginners] https://web.pdx.edu/~jkh/Chandler,%20Semiotics_for_Beginners.html
Key Quote: "Meaning emerges from indexical use and structure, not just conventional connections."
Core Argument / Thesis: Human culture contains diverse semiotic processes; synthetic systems need not be limited to human-centered semantics.
Example: Indexical gestures, pragmatic cues, and evolving codes in both human and machine communication.
Visual Concept / Cartoon Scene: A collage of symbols, gestures, and icons, some familiar, some alien, with arrows showing their transformation.

Slide 6: Modeling Cultural Drift and Emergence
Thinker / Source: Yuri Lotman, Bateson
URL: [Lotman, Semiosphere] https://web.pdx.edu/~jkh/Chandler,%20Semiotics_for_Beginners.html
Key Quote: "The functional value of synthetic semiotics lies precisely in their ability to demonstrate how meaning emerges, drifts, and transforms through use."
Core Argument / Thesis: Synthetic semiotics model cultural change by making visible the processes of drift, recursion, and emergent meaning.
Example: AI-generated languages or memes that evolve through repeated use and reinterpretation.
Visual Concept / Cartoon Scene: A river labeled "meaning" splitting and merging as it flows through landscapes of humans and machines.

Slide 7: Conclusions and Implications
Thinker / Source: Hodge & Kress, Bateson
URL: [Chandler, Semiotics for Beginners] (see above)
Key Quote: "Synthetic semiotics offers not a pale imitation of human meaning-making but a powerful tool for exploring how meaning itself comes into being through interaction and use."
Core Argument / Thesis: Rather than fidelity to fixed frameworks, the value of synthetic communication systems is in revealing and accelerating the emergence of meaning through interaction.
Example: Collaborative creation of new sign systems in digital communities.
Visual Concept / Cartoon Scene: A festival where humans and AIs co-create new symbols, some leaking into the air and morphing into unexpected patterns.
