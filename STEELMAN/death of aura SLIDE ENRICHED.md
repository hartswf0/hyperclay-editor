Slide 1: Title Slide
Title: Death of Aura: AI, Remix Culture, and the Future of Originality
Subtitle: From Dispossession to Agency in Generative Art
Visual Concept / Cartoon Scene: A mirror reflecting a collage of artworks, styles, and faces—some human, some AI—blending into each other, with the word "Aura" dissolving into pixels.

Slide 2: Remix as the Foundation of Culture

Key Quote: “Nothing can be created without influence or context—without input from the outside.”
Core Argument / Thesis: All art is built on influence, imitation, and remix; AI simply scales and automates this process, making visible what has always been true of cultural production.
Example: AI-generated music that samples and recombines motifs from thousands of songs across genres and eras.
Visual Concept / Cartoon Scene: An artist and an AI each adding pieces to a giant mosaic, their tiles overlapping and blending.

Slide 3: The Real Anxiety—Dispossession and Statistical Stylesheets

Key Quote: “Our creative identities can be separated from us, rendered as data, and redeployed at scale.”
Core Argument / Thesis: The anxiety is not about theft, but about who benefits from remixing—AI enables extraction of style, voice, and identity into statistical forms, often without originator consent.
Example: An AI mimicking a living artist’s style to generate new works sold commercially, while the original artist receives no recognition or compensation.
Visual Concept / Cartoon Scene: A conveyor belt moving colorful "style" packages from a crowd of artists to a factory labeled "AI," which repackages them into new products.

Slide 4: The Embarrassing Possibility—Mathematical Extractability of Self

Key Quote: “The thing that felt most *you* was *mathematically extractable*.”
Core Argument / Thesis: AI’s ability to extract and recombine personal style exposes the constructedness of self and originality, revealing identity as an assemblage of patterns and influences.
Example: A writer’s unique narrative quirks being captured in an AI model, which can then generate new stories in their "voice."
Visual Concept / Cartoon Scene: An AI scanner extracting glowing threads from a person’s head and weaving them into a tapestry shared by many.

Slide 5: The Death of Aura—Benjamin’s Prophecy Realized

Key Quote: “The ‘aura’ of a work... its unique presence in time and space... was bound up in tradition and ritual, and mass reproduction would inevitably shatter this aura.”
Core Argument / Thesis: AI is the latest step in the loss of aura, revealing that originality is always already a remix shaped by context, tradition, and collective memory.
Example: AI-generated art that is indistinguishable from human work, challenging the notion of uniqueness and authenticity.
Visual Concept / Cartoon Scene: A glowing "aura" around a painting dissolving as dozens of identical copies (digital and physical) appear around it.

Slide 6: Beyond Thin Evaluations—The Need for Thick, Situated Understanding

Key Quote: “The real stakes are not just technical or legal, but existential and communal: whose stories get told, who gets to benefit, and how communities can reclaim agency in the remixing of their own identities.”
Core Argument / Thesis: Debates about AI and culture must move beyond technical metrics to consider context, meaning, and agency in cultural representation.
Example: Community-driven projects that use AI to reclaim and remix marginalized cultural narratives.
Visual Concept / Cartoon Scene: A group of people and AIs collaboratively painting a mural, each adding their own symbols and stories.

Slide 7: Conclusion—The System Didn’t Break Originality, It Made It Visible

Key Quote: “Remix culture is not the enemy of originality. It is its condition of possibility. AI just holds up the mirror.”
Core Argument / Thesis: The challenge is not to restore a lost aura, but to develop new forms of agency, recognition, and benefit-sharing in a world where all creation is, and always has been, a remix.
Example: Artists and communities developing new legal, economic, and creative frameworks for attribution and benefit-sharing in the age of AI.
Visual Concept / Cartoon Scene: A mirror reflecting a diverse crowd of creators, each holding a unique, remixable artifact, with the word “Originality” refracted into many colors.
