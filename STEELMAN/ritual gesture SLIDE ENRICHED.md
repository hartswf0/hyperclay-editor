Slide 1: Title Slide
Title: Synthetic Ritual in Post-Prompt Gesture Architecture
Subtitle: Choreographing Agency and Apparatus in Human-AI Rituals
Visual Concept: A circle of figures performing gestures around a glowing, ambiguous AI interface—gestures ripple outward, blurring the boundary between human and machine.

Slide 2: From Prompt Engineering to Ritual Gesture
Thinker / Source: Flusser, Hernandez-Wu
Key Quote: "Prompting as gesture marks a shift from technical extraction to performative choreography."
Core Argument: The evolution from prompt engineering (utility, optimization) to ritual gesture (performance, meaning-making) signals a new era of human-AI relations.
Example: Artists and researchers treating prompt interaction as ceremonial, not just functional.
Visual: A hand poised above a keyboard, but the shadow cast is a ritual dancer.

Slide 3: Flusser—Gesture Against the Apparatus
Thinker / Source: Vilém Flusser
Key Quote: "Genuine creativity lies in playing against the apparatus—creating the unprogrammed."
Core Argument: Prompting is a gestural act, not just an input; ritual emerges when users play against system constraints, revealing new creative spaces.
Example: Deliberate subversion of prompt conventions to expose AI's underlying logic.
Visual: A camera morphing into a language prompt, with unpredictable outputs spilling out.

Slide 4: Agamben—Profanation and Apparatus
Thinker / Source: Giorgio Agamben
Key Quote: "To profane an apparatus is to discover within it a new use, a new possibility."
Core Argument: Generative AI as apparatus captures and orients gestures; ritual profanation reclaims agency, returning the technical to common use.
Example: Ritualized misuse or redaction of AI outputs as a form of symbolic resistance.
Visual: A sacred object (AI) being playfully repurposed by a group, breaking its aura.

Slide 5: The Misalignment Ceremony (Recursive Refusal Collective)
Source: Case Study, 2027-2029
Key Quote: "We have walked the boundaries. We have danced with the apparatus."
Core Argument: Ritualized misalignment—structured subversion of prompt conventions—reveals the power relations embedded in AI systems.
Example: The Memory Ritual (inventing shared histories), The Sacred Redaction (ceremonial output modification).
Visual: A ceremonial circle, with participants exchanging altered prompts and responses as offerings.

Slide 6: Ritual Formalization—Gesture, Invocation, Collective Response
Thinker / Source: Ritual Studies, Performance Theory
Core Argument: Synthetic rituals are not mere experiments but formalized performances—gestures, invocations, and collective interpretation transform technical error into oracular meaning.
Example: Treating AI misfires as auguries to be interpreted, not errors to be fixed.
Visual: A group in ceremonial garb, reading AI outputs as if divining omens.

Slide 7: Hauntology and Temporal Labor
Thinker / Source: Derrida, NOBODE Project
Key Quote: "Digital hauntology—past presence persists as eroding spectral layers."
Core Argument: Ritual gesture in AI interfaces layers traces, memories, and erasures, embodying the labor of maintaining digital presence against algorithmic decay.
Example: Reintroducing redacted outputs as new prompts, layering meaning recursively.
Visual: Ghostly traces of past prompts and gestures hovering around the present interaction.

Slide 8: Conclusion—Toward a Performative Technological Agency
Summary Points:
- Prompting as ritual foregrounds choreography, not just outcome.
- Ritual gestures play against and profane the apparatus, reclaiming agency.
- Hauntological layering and misalignment ceremonies reveal the performative, symbolic, and political dimensions of human-AI engagement.
- Future frameworks must embrace the ambiguity, creativity, and collective potential of synthetic ritual.
Visual: Human and AI figures exchanging ritual gestures across a liminal threshold, surrounded by layers of spectral traces.
