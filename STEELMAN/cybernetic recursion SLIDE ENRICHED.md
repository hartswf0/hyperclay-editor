Slide 1: Title Slide
Title: Cybernetic Recursion: Mutuality, Meaning, and the Black Box
Subtitle: Second-Order Cybernetics and Human-AI Interaction
Visual Concept / Cartoon Scene: Two observers (one human, one AI) peering into a black box, with arrows looping between them and the box, forming a circular feedback loop.

Slide 2: Cybernetic Recursion and Functional Mutuality

Key Quote: "Functional mutuality need not require shared interiority... what matters is the circularity of interaction and the observer's inevitable presence within the system." (von Foerster)
Core Argument / Thesis: Meaningful interaction does not depend on shared internal states but on recursive, circular exchanges between observer and system.
Example: Human and AI both adapting to each other's outputs, creating emergent meaning through ongoing feedback.
Visual Concept / Cartoon Scene: Two hands (one human, one robotic) passing a glowing orb back and forth, with the orb changing color each time.

Slide 3: The Black Box and Observer Construct
Thinker / Source: Heinz von Foerster

Key Quote: "The 'Black Box' is essentially and crucially a construct of the observer where meaning emerges through interaction rather than through accessing internal states."
Core Argument / Thesis: The observer's role is central—meaning arises from interaction, not from uncovering hidden interiors.
Example: Treating an AI system as a black box whose value is in its responses, not in its internal mechanisms.
Visual Concept / Cartoon Scene: A person and an AI each drawing symbols on the outside of a sealed black box, watching how the other responds.

Slide 4: Double Hermeneutic in Human-AI Interaction

Key Quote: "Everyday 'lay' concepts and those from the social sciences have a two-way relationship." (Giddens)
Core Argument / Thesis: In human-AI interaction, both parties interpret and influence each other, creating a feedback loop of mutual recognition at different epistemic layers.
Example: A user adapts their prompts based on AI responses, while the AI adapts its outputs based on user input patterns.
Visual Concept / Cartoon Scene: Two speech bubbles (one human, one AI) looping around each other, each containing a mirror reflecting the other.

Slide 5: Agency Without Metaphysics
Thinker / Source: Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Agency), von Foerster
URL: [Stanford] https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/agency/ | [von Foerster] (see above)
Key Quote: "Agency might not be reducible to 'the agent's being moved by reasons or intentions.'"
Core Argument / Thesis: Agency can be understood as functional and emergent, not necessarily rooted in metaphysical interiority or human-like intentionality.
Example: An AI system that exhibits agency through its actions and effects, regardless of whether it has mental states.
Visual Concept / Cartoon Scene: A chessboard where both human and AI hands make moves, with the board glowing at points of emergent strategy.

Slide 6: Mimicry as Cultural Interface
Thinker / Source: Heinz von Foerster, Gordon Pask
URL: [von Foerster] (see above) | [Pask] (see above)
Key Quote: "We can 'compute stable realities' through recursive observation, and these become the 'objects' with which we interact."
Core Argument / Thesis: Mimicry between human and AI is not mere imitation but the creation of new cultural patterns through recursive interaction.
Example: AI and human co-developing a unique style of conversation or problem-solving that neither could achieve alone.
Visual Concept / Cartoon Scene: A tapestry being woven by two figures (human and AI), with threads labeled "pattern recognition," "feedback," and "culture."

Slide 7: Implications for Ethnographic Approaches

Key Quote: "Focus on the 'mutual model' that emerges from interaction rather than attempting to access some presumed interior state."
Core Argument / Thesis: Ethnography can center on the emergent properties of human-AI interaction, while remaining alert to the risks of epistemic injustice and interpretive mismatch.
Example: Studying how humans and AI co-create new practices, while examining where mutual modeling breaks down.
Visual Concept / Cartoon Scene: Researchers observing a dance between human and AI avatars, with some steps perfectly matched and others out of sync.

Slide 8: Conclusion
Summary Points:
- Meaningful interaction emerges from recursive, circular exchanges—not shared interiority.
- Human-AI mutual recognition creates new forms of culture and agency.
- Ethnography should focus on emergent models and remain vigilant about interpretive gaps.
Visual Concept / Cartoon Scene: The human and AI from Slide 1 now standing together, surrounded by a network of glowing feedback loops, holding a shared symbol of emergent meaning.
