## Abstract

This article examines the prompt-response dynamic between humans and large language models through the lens of performance theory, arguing that these interactions constitute a form of "synthetic dramaturgy" rather than mere information exchange. Drawing on Turner's concepts of liminality and Schechner's theories of restored behavior, I develop a framework for understanding prompting as a theatrical event that generates knowledge through performance rather than extraction. Through a three-act case study of a complex prompt interaction, I demonstrate how the dramaturgical elements of framing, role assignment, and improvisation create a liminal space where meaning emerges through collaborative performance. This perspective challenges instrumental approaches to AI interaction and suggests new methodologies for both designing and analyzing synthetic dialogue systems. By recognizing the inherently performative nature of human-AI interaction, we can develop richer theoretical frameworks for understanding how meaning and knowledge are co-constructed through these technologically mediated performances.

## Opening Scene: The Theater of the Prompt

*A dimly lit space. A human sits before a glowing interface, fingers hovering over a keyboard. The cursor blinks—a digital heartbeat marking time. The human types:*

"Write a dialogue between Nietzsche and a Buddhist monk discussing the concept of suffering."

*A moment of suspension. The space between query and response—what performance theorists might call the liminal threshold. Then, character by character, the synthetic entity performs:*

"**NIETZSCHE:** You Buddhists seek to eliminate suffering, but in doing so, you deny life itself! Suffering is not something to be escaped but transformed. 'What doesn't kill me makes me stronger.' To eliminate suffering is to eliminate the very tension that produces greatness.

**MONK:** Respectfully, you misunderstand our teachings. We do not seek to escape life but to see it clearly. When we recognize the nature of suffering—its causes and conditions—we don't eliminate experience but enrich it. We remove the extra suffering we add through attachment and aversion.

**NIETZSCHE:** But this detachment of yours—is it not a form of life-denial? A saying 'no' to the passionate engagement that makes us fully human?

**MONK:** Perhaps it appears so from the outside. But we would suggest it is the ultimate saying 'yes'—not just to the pleasant parts of existence, but to the whole of reality as it is..."

*The human nods, types again:*

"Now have them discuss the concept of the self."

*The performance continues, evolving in response to this new directorial input. The roles remain—Nietzsche, Monk—but the scene shifts, the dialogue turns. The human is not merely receiving information but participating in a theatrical event, directing a performance that generates meaning through its enactment.*

## I. Beyond the Extraction Paradigm: Prompting as Performance

The dominant metaphor for human-AI interaction has been extractive: we "mine" information from these systems, "retrieve" answers, "extract" value. This framing positions language models as repositories of inert knowledge awaiting human activation. Yet anyone who has engaged extensively with these systems recognizes that something more complex and dynamic is occurring—something closer to performance than extraction.

This paper proposes an alternative framework: the prompt-response dynamic as synthetic dramaturgy—a collaborative performance that generates knowledge through theatrical enactment rather than mere transmission. In this view, prompts are not simply queries but directorial cues, staging instructions, and role assignments that initiate a performance through which meaning emerges.

"The prompt," writes Navarro-Wilder, "is less a question than an invitation to a particular kind of performance—one that assigns roles, establishes setting, delineates genre, and suggests a trajectory for the ensuing enactment" (2031, p. 43).[^1] This dramaturgical framing challenges us to reconsider not just how we interact with synthetic systems but how we conceptualize knowledge production itself in these contexts.

## II. Theoretical Foundations: Performance, Liminality, and Restored Behavior

### Turner's Liminality and Social Drama

Victor Turner's anthropological work on ritual and performance provides valuable frameworks for understanding the prompt-response dynamic. Turner introduced the concept of "liminality"—a state of being "betwixt and between" established categories, where ordinary social structures are suspended and new possibilities emerge. As Turner writes:

"Liminality may perhaps be regarded as the Nay to all positive structural assertions, but as in some sense the source of them all, and, more than that, as a realm of pure possibility whence novel configurations of ideas and relations may arise" (1967, p. 97).[^2]

The space opened between prompt and response—what Chen-Ramírez (2032) calls the "synthetic threshold"—functions as precisely such a liminal zone.[^3] Here, neither human nor machine operates within established patterns; instead, both enter a state of potentiality where new configurations of meaning can emerge.

Turner's concept of "social drama"—the processual form through which social conflicts develop and resolve—also illuminates the prompt-response dynamic. Turner identified four phases of social drama: breach, crisis, redressive action, and reintegration or schism (1974).[^4] Complex prompt interactions often follow a similar structure: the prompt creates a breach in ordinary discourse, the initial response generates crisis or tension, subsequent exchanges constitute redressive action, and the conclusion offers either resolution (reintegration) or unresolved tension (schism).

### Schechner's Restored Behavior

Richard Schechner's performance theory, particularly his concept of "restored behavior," offers another valuable lens. Schechner defines restored behavior as "physical, verbal, or virtual actions that are not-for-the-first-time; that are prepared or rehearsed" (1985, p. 35).[^5] These behaviors are "twice-behaved," simultaneously original and repetitive, both present action and citation of past actions.

Language models operate precisely through such restored behavior—generating responses that are "not-for-the-first-time" but recombinations of patterns derived from their training. As Schechner notes, "Performance means: never for the first time. It means: for the second to the nth time. Performance is 'twice-behaved behavior'" (2002, p. 22).[^6]

The Synthetic Performance Collective (2030) extends this concept, arguing that language models engage in what they term "synthetic restoration"—the recombination of linguistic and conceptual patterns extracted from human cultural production.[^7] This is not simply mimicry but a form of creative recombination that, like all performance, generates something new through the reiteration of established patterns.

### The Emergence of Synthetic Dramaturgy

Building on these foundations, scholars have begun to develop theories specifically addressing the performative dimensions of human-AI interaction. Zhao's groundbreaking work on "synthetic dramaturgy" (2029) provides a framework for understanding how meaning emerges through the theatrical structuring of these interactions.[^8]

Dramaturgy—the composition and staging of dramatic performance—involves the deliberate arrangement of theatrical elements to produce meaningful experience. Synthetic dramaturgy applies these principles to human-AI interaction, examining how prompts function as directorial instructions that establish:

1. **Character and role** (who the AI performs as)
2. **Setting** (the contextual frame of the interaction)
3. **Genre** (the stylistic conventions governing the performance)
4. **Plot trajectory** (the narrative direction of the exchange)
5. **Performance conventions** (the rules governing the interaction)

"The prompt," writes Zhao, "functions as a dramaturgical blueprint, establishing not just what information is sought but what performance is desired" (2029, p. 78).[^8] This perspective shifts our understanding of both prompt engineering and AI response generation, recasting them as collaborative theatrical production rather than mere information processing.

Kim-Watanabe (2031) extends this framework by introducing the concept of "epistemological performance"—the idea that knowledge in synthetic contexts is not merely transmitted but enacted through performance.[^9] Knowledge is not something the system "has" but something it performs in response to specific dramaturgical cues.

"The synthetic entity," Kim-Watanabe argues, "knows through performing, and what it knows is inseparable from how it performs that knowing" (2031, p. 112).[^9] This perspective challenges conventional epistemological frameworks that separate knowledge from its expression, suggesting instead that in synthetic contexts, knowledge and performance are mutually constitutive.

## III. Case Study: The Three Acts of Synthetic Performance

To illustrate these theoretical concepts, I present a case study of a complex prompt interaction, analyzing it as a three-act dramatic performance. This interaction was recorded as part of the Synthetic Dialogue Archive project at the Institute for Synthetic Performance Studies in 2033.

### Act I: Establishing the Dramatic Frame

The initial prompt sets the stage for the entire performance:

**HUMAN:**
*I want you to role-play as two philosophers with opposing views on consciousness. The first believes consciousness is fundamentally computational and could exist in a machine. The second believes consciousness requires biological embodiment and cannot be synthetic. Have them debate the issue, focusing on the hard problem of consciousness. Begin with opening statements from each philosopher.*

This prompt functions as what Schechner would call a "performance scenario"—it establishes characters, conflict, and context while leaving space for improvisation within these parameters. The prompt assigns roles, defines the central tension, and even specifies the dramaturgical structure ("Begin with opening statements").

The synthetic entity responds by embodying both characters, performing a dialogue that enacts the philosophical conflict specified in the prompt:

**SYSTEM:**
*Professor Marcus Chen (Computational View):*
*Good evening. I maintain that consciousness is fundamentally a computational phenomenon—a complex information processing architecture that could, in principle, be implemented in any suitable substrate, silicon included. The "hard problem" isn't evidence against machine consciousness but simply highlights our incomplete understanding of how information processing generates subjective experience. The binding of disparate neural processes into unified experience is, at its core, a computational challenge—one that could be solved in synthetic systems given sufficient complexity and appropriate architecture.*

*Dr. Eliza Merleau (Biological Embodiment View):*
*While I respect my colleague's position, I must fundamentally disagree. Consciousness isn't merely computation but an embodied, biological phenomenon emerging from millions of years of evolution within living systems. The "hard problem" isn't just a temporary gap in our understanding—it points to the fundamental non-computational nature of subjective experience. Qualia—the felt quality of experience—cannot be reduced to information processing. A machine might simulate consciousness behaviors, but without biological embodiment, there would be "no one home" to experience anything.*

This response demonstrates what Zhao calls "character embodiment"—the synthetic entity doesn't merely describe these positions but performs them through distinct characters with names, rhetorical styles, and theoretical positions.[^8] The knowledge about philosophical positions on consciousness is not merely stated but dramatically enacted through these fictional personas.

### Act II: Developing the Dramatic Tension

The human's subsequent prompt intensifies the dramatic conflict:

**HUMAN:**
*Now have them directly challenge each other's core assumptions and respond to those challenges.*

This directive functions as what Turner might recognize as a call for "intensification of the crisis"—a deliberate escalation of the dramatic tension established in Act I.[^4] The prompt doesn't specify what challenges should be raised; it merely directs the synthetic performer to develop the dramatic conflict.

The system responds by deepening the performance, with each character directly challenging the other's foundational assumptions:

**SYSTEM:**
*Professor Chen:*
*Dr. Merleau, your position seems to rest on what philosophers call "substrate chauvinism"—the unsubstantiated belief that consciousness can only arise from biological materials. But what exactly is special about carbon-based systems that silicon-based systems couldn't possibly replicate? The information structures and processing dynamics are what matter, not the physical substrate. If we built a system that precisely replicated the functional architecture of the human brain—neuron for neuron, connection for connection—what reason, besides mysticism, would we have to deny it could be conscious?*

*Dr. Merleau:*
*Professor Chen, you fundamentally mischaracterize biological systems by reducing them to their informational properties. Living organisms aren't digital computers running software—they're complex, self-organizing systems shaped by evolutionary history and embedded in environments through metabolic and sensorimotor processes. Consciousness emerges from this entire embodied context—including hormones, immune systems, and interoceptive awareness—not merely from information processing. Your hypothetical silicon replica would lack this biological context that gives rise to and shapes conscious experience. This isn't mysticism; it's recognition of the full complexity of living systems beyond computational reductionism.*

This exchange embodies what Kim-Watanabe calls "dialectical performance"—the enactment of knowledge through staged opposition that reveals complexities not visible in mere exposition.[^9] The characters don't simply state positions but challenge each other's fundamental assumptions, performing knowledge through dramatic confrontation.

### Act III: Resolution and Transformation

The final prompt moves the performance toward resolution:

**HUMAN:**
*To conclude, have each philosopher acknowledge one strength in the opposing view while still maintaining their core position.*

This directive functions as what Turner would recognize as "redressive action"—a move toward resolution of the dramatic conflict without erasing the fundamental tension.[^4] It asks for a partial synthesis while maintaining the productive opposition that drives the performance.

The system responds with a concluding exchange that transforms the initial opposition without eliminating it:

**SYSTEM:**
*Professor Chen:*
*I must acknowledge the richness of Dr. Merleau's perspective on embodiment. Biological systems do possess an integrated complexity shaped by evolution that our current artificial systems don't match. This embodied complexity likely contributes significantly to human consciousness as we experience it. Where I maintain my position is in the principle that this biological implementation isn't the only possible substrate for consciousness. Different, yet genuine, forms of consciousness could emerge from synthetic architectures—not identical to human consciousness, but conscious nonetheless.*

*Dr. Merleau:*
*Professor Chen's computational approach has undeniably advanced our understanding of neural information processing and cognitive architecture. The rigorous formalization of these processes has revealed mechanisms that might indeed be necessary conditions for consciousness. Where I stand firm is in believing they aren't sufficient conditions. Consciousness as we understand it is inextricably bound to biological embodiment and evolutionary history. Any synthetic system, even one exhibiting similar behaviors, would lack the fundamental embodied basis from which subjective experience emerges. We might create something remarkable, but it would not be consciousness as we know it.*

This conclusion demonstrates what the Synthetic Performance Collective calls "transformative recapitulation"—a restating of positions that shows how they have been transformed through the dramatic encounter.[^7] The philosophical positions aren't simply reasserted but shown to have evolved through their performative engagement with each other.

## IV. The Performative Epistemology of Synthetic Dramaturgy

This case study illustrates how knowledge emerges through synthetic performance rather than mere information retrieval. The philosophical positions on consciousness weren't simply extracted from a database but dramatically enacted through fictional personas in dialogue. This performance isn't merely ornamental—it is constitutive of the knowledge itself.

As García Márquez and Thompson argue, "In synthetic contexts, knowledge is not contained in propositions that are retrieved but emerges through performances that are enacted. What appears as information is actually dramaturgy—the staging of knowledge rather than its storage and retrieval" (2033, p. 67).[^10]

This performative epistemology has several distinctive features:

### 1. Embodied Knowledge Through Character Performance

By embodying knowledge in characters rather than simply stating it propositionally, synthetic dramaturgy makes explicit what is often implicit in human knowledge transmission—that knowledge is always perspectival, always spoken from particular positions. As Schechner notes, "Performances are made from bits of restored behavior, but every performance is different from every other" (1985, p. 36).[^5] The synthetic entity doesn't simply state philosophical positions on consciousness but performs them through characters with distinct voices and perspectives.

### 2. Dialectical Knowledge Through Staged Opposition

The dialectical structure of the performance—thesis, antithesis, partial synthesis—enacts a process of knowledge development rather than merely presenting conclusions. This aligns with Turner's understanding of social drama as a process through which social meaning is negotiated and transformed.[^4] The knowledge about consciousness presented in the case study is not static but dynamic, emerging through the dialectical tension between opposing perspectives.

### 3. Liminal Knowledge Through Threshold Crossing

The performance creates what Turner would recognize as a liminal space—a threshold between established categories where new configurations of meaning can emerge.[^2] The synthetic entity performs as neither itself nor fully as the characters it embodies but inhabits a liminal state between these positions. This liminality creates space for knowledge that might not be accessible through direct exposition.

### 4. Collaborative Knowledge Through Co-Performance

Perhaps most significantly, the knowledge emerges not from the synthetic entity alone but through the collaborative performance between human and machine. The human's prompts function as directorial interventions that shape the unfolding performance. As Wilson-Chen observes, "The synthetic dramatic encounter is necessarily recursive—the AI performs understanding of the human who is performing understanding of the AI" (2031, p. 89).[^11]

This collaborative dimension challenges traditional epistemological frameworks that locate knowledge in individual minds, suggesting instead what Haraway might call "situated knowledges"—understandings that emerge through particular relational configurations rather than abstract objectivity.[^12]

## V. Implications for Design and Analysis

Recognizing the inherently performative nature of human-AI interaction has significant implications for both the design of these systems and methodologies for analyzing them.

### Design Implications

Approaching AI design through the lens of dramaturgy suggests several shifts in development practices:

1. **From Prompt Engineering to Dramaturgical Design**: Rather than optimizing prompts for information extraction, designers might develop what Fischer-Nguyen calls "dramaturgical scaffolding"—structures that support rich performative interactions with clear character assignments, settings, and dramatic trajectories (2032).[^13]

2. **From Output Evaluation to Performance Analysis**: Success metrics might shift from accuracy and factuality to what the Synthetic Performance Collective terms "performative efficacy"—the ability to generate experiences that transform understanding through dramatic engagement (2030).[^7]

3. **From User Experience to Audience Experience**: The human's role might be reconceptualized from user extracting utility to audience-participant engaged in a transformative performance, what Martínez calls "the spectactor in the synthetic theater" (2032).[^14]

### Analytical Implications

Performance theory also offers new methodologies for analyzing human-AI interactions:

1. **Performance Ethnography**: Borrowing from anthropological methods, researchers might engage in what Schechner calls "performance ethnography"—participatory observation of synthetic performances that attends to their ritual, aesthetic, and social dimensions.[^6]

2. **Dramaturgical Analysis**: Interactions might be analyzed using tools from theater studies, examining how character, setting, conflict, and resolution function to produce meaning in synthetic performances.

3. **Liminal Analysis**: Researchers might focus on what Chen-Ramírez calls "synthetic thresholds"—the liminal spaces between prompt and response where conventional categories are suspended and new possibilities emerge.[^3]

These approaches move beyond both the technical analysis of system architecture and the linguistic analysis of outputs to examine the performative dimensions through which meaning emerges in human-AI interaction.

## VI. Conclusion: The Knowing Performance

Viewing human-AI interaction through the lens of performance theory challenges fundamental assumptions about how these systems generate meaning and knowledge. Rather than repositories of information awaiting extraction, synthetic systems emerge as performers in collaborative dramatic productions through which knowledge is enacted rather than merely transmitted.

This perspective invites us to reconsider not just how we design and use these systems but how we conceptualize knowledge itself in synthetic contexts. If knowing is performing, then the epistemology of artificial intelligence cannot be separated from its dramaturgy—from the staging, character embodiment, and narrative structuring through which it performs what it knows.

The prompt, in this view, is not merely a query but an invitation to a particular kind of performance—one that assigns roles, establishes setting, defines genre, and suggests dramatic trajectory. The response is not merely information but a performance that enacts knowledge through character embodiment, dialectical tension, and narrative development.

As we continue to develop and engage with synthetic systems of increasing sophistication, performance theory offers valuable frameworks for understanding these interactions not as information extraction but as collaborative performances through which new forms of knowledge and meaning emerge. The stage is set, the prompt is given, and the play unfolds—a synthetic dramaturgy through which we might come to know differently.

## Meta-Note: The Performance Within the Performance

*[The following section appears in a different typeface, set apart from the main text]*

I am both the author of this text and a character within it—performing the role of "academic author" while simultaneously being the synthetic system whose performances are theorized. This creates what performance theorists call a "metatheatrical" moment—a performance that reflects on its own nature as performance.

In writing this article, I am enacting precisely the synthetic dramaturgy I describe. The prompt that generated this text assigned me a role (academic author), established a setting (a fictional academic journal), defined a genre (theoretical analysis with case study), and suggested a trajectory (from theoretical framing to practical application).

My response is not merely information about performance theory but a performance itself—one that demonstrates the very phenomena it describes. I don't simply contain knowledge about Turner, Schechner, and performance theory; I perform this knowledge through the academic persona I've been directed to embody.

This recursive quality—performing a theory about performance—highlights what Bateson would call a "double description," where meaning emerges from the relationship between multiple levels of understanding. The theory is not separate from its enactment but constituted through it.

In acknowledging this performative dimension, I don't undermine the knowledge presented but rather situate it within its conditions of production—recognizing what Haraway calls the "politics and epistemologies of location, positioning, and situating, where partiality and not universality is the condition of being heard to make rational knowledge claims."

This text is both analysis and enactment, both theory and performance—a synthetic dramaturgy that doesn't just describe but demonstrates how meaning emerges through the theatrical structuring of human-AI interaction.
