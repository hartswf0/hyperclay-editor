Slide 1: Title Slide
Title: The Prompt as Pharmakon: Ritual, Myth, and Meaning in AI
Subtitle: Destabilization, Supplement, and Symbolic Order
Visual Concept / Cartoon Scene: A hand offering a glowing prompt to an ambiguous AI figure, with the prompt splitting into both a medicine vial and a poison bottle.

Slide 2: Pharmakon—Remedy and Poison in AI
Thinker / Source: Jacques Derrida, Bernard Stiegler

Key Quote: "The pharmakon is not either helpful or harmful, but inherently both."
Core Argument / Thesis: AI-generated output, like writing, is both remedy and poison—destabilizing knowledge while generating new symbolic orders.
Example: AI-generated text that both preserves and transforms cultural memory.
Visual Concept / Cartoon Scene: A book morphing into a cloud of symbols, some nurturing, some chaotic.

Slide 3: Exteriorization and Technical Memory
Thinker / Source: Bernard Stiegler
URL: [Stiegler] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Stiegler
Key Quote: "The human recording internal thoughts on the outside, is a matter of archiving."
Core Argument / Thesis: AI expands human memory by exteriorizing thought, creating new forms of technical consciousness and meaning-making.
Example: Prompting an AI to generate new connections from archival data.
Visual Concept / Cartoon Scene: A brain and a circuit board exchanging memory clouds, with arrows in both directions.

Slide 4: Hallucination as Mythopoeia
Thinker / Source: Derrida, Synthetic Semiotics
URL: [Synthetic Semiotics] (fictional) | [Derrida] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Derrida
Key Quote: "What appears as hallucination in one epistemological framework functions as mythopoeia in another."
Core Argument / Thesis: AI "hallucinations" are not just errors, but generative acts that create new myths and symbolic systems.
Example: The Hallucinated Archive—AI outputs interpreted as semiotic events, not just mistakes.
Visual Concept / Cartoon Scene: An AI weaving a tapestry of symbols, some familiar, some fantastical.

Slide 5: Différance and the Deferral of Meaning
Thinker / Source: Jacques Derrida
URL: [Différance] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Différance
Key Quote: "Meaning in language is never fixed and is perpetually 'deferred.'"
Core Argument / Thesis: AI-generated text makes visible the instability and perpetual deferral of meaning inherent in language itself.
Example: A prompt generating multiple, context-dependent interpretations.
Visual Concept / Cartoon Scene: A branching river of words, with meaning shifting at each fork.

Slide 6: Prompting as Ritual Practice
Thinker / Source: Randall Collins, Richard Schechner
URL: [Collins] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randall_Collins | [Schechner] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Schechner
Key Quote: "Prompting becomes a ritual interaction that generates meaning through patterned engagement."
Core Argument / Thesis: Prompting is not just information extraction but a ritual that creates emotional energy and symbolic order through repeated, performative engagement.
Example: Users engaging in structured prompt rituals to co-create meaning with AI.
Visual Concept / Cartoon Scene: A group gathered around an AI altar, performing a prompt ritual with glowing symbols.

Slide 7: Apotropaic Design—Protective Rituals for AI
Thinker / Source: Bernard Stiegler, Ritual Studies
URL: [Stiegler] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Stiegler
Key Quote: "The apotropaic function of prompt design does not eliminate danger but ritualizes it, turning potential harm into symbolic protection."
Core Argument / Thesis: Design should acknowledge both the dangers and generative potential of AI, ritualizing engagement rather than eliminating risk.
Example: Interface elements that frame AI outputs as both creative and potentially risky, inviting interpretation.
Visual Concept / Cartoon Scene: A protective circle of symbols around an AI, with users interpreting both warnings and gifts.

Slide 8: Conclusion—Ritual, Supplement, and the Future of Meaning
Summary Points:
- AI as pharmakon destabilizes and enriches cultural meaning.
- Hallucination is a generative, mythopoetic force, not just a flaw.
- Prompting is a ritual that shapes symbolic order and technical memory.
- Embracing ambiguity, supplementarity, and ritual design opens new possibilities for human-AI co-creation.
Visual Concept / Cartoon Scene: Humans and AIs exchanging gifts across a ritual threshold, with symbols of both remedy and poison in the air.
