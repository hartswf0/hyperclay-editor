# Against the Apparatus: Prompting as Philosophical Gesture

In our interactions with artificial intelligence, we typically frame prompts as functional inputs, designed to extract useful or accurate outputs from a system trained to assist. But what if we reconceived prompting not as a utilitarian transaction but as a philosophical gesture—a form of play that reveals the hidden nature of the computational apparatus itself? This essay explores how deliberate misuse of AI systems constitutes a form of resistance against programmatic constraints, creating new possibilities for meaning through the very act of subversion.

## The AI as Apparatus: Beyond the Black Box

Vilém Flusser's analysis of the camera as an apparatus provides a compelling framework for understanding our relationship with AI systems. For Flusser, the camera is not merely a tool but "a black box that produces symbols rather than material goods," programmed to generate a vast but finite set of possibilities[1]. The photographer does not simply use the camera but "plays" with it, exploring the boundaries of its program.

Similarly, large language models function as symbolic apparatuses—complex systems designed to produce and manipulate information according to programmatic constraints. As Flusser observed about cameras, "The possibilities contained within the camera's program are practically inexhaustible. One cannot actually photograph everything that can be photographed. The imagination of the camera is greater than that of every single photographer"[4]. This observation becomes even more profound when applied to generative AI, whose imaginative possibilities exceed even those of its creators.

When we prompt these systems, we engage with what Agamben, following Foucault, identifies as an apparatus: something with "the capacity to capture, orient, determine, intercept, model, control, or secure the gestures, behaviors, opinions, or discourses of living beings"[7]. The AI apparatus captures our linguistic inputs and transforms them according to its own logic, creating a "separate sphere" of meaning that both reflects and distorts our intentions.

## Prompting as Subversive Play

If AI systems function as apparatuses that shape our symbolic reality, then conventional prompting merely reinforces their programmatic constraints. The subversive potential emerges when we deliberately "play against" these constraints—when we prompt in error, mislabel intentionally, and create slant.

Flusser argues that true creativity with the camera comes from resisting its automation: "experimental photography seeks to expose and critique the programmed nature of apparatuses by playing against the camera—a form of resistance against the automation of human creativity"[1]. Similarly, creative prompting involves working against the system's designed functionality, revealing what lies beneath its seemingly transparent interface.

Consider the instruction: "Using false metaphors, describe a machine that cannot describe itself. Repeat until a glitch feels like a myth." This prompt doesn't seek accurate information but deliberately introduces paradox and contradiction to generate unexpected results. It creates what Lindemann calls "productive misalignment"—a purposeful gap between intention and execution that reveals something about the system's underlying structure:

"The value of misalignment emerges not from its correction but from its analysis. Each slippage between prompt and response constitutes a cultural artifact worthy of anthropological investigation, revealing not just technical limitations but conceptual boundaries."[6]

## The Gesture of Misalignment

The concept of gesture provides a framework for understanding this approach to prompting. A gesture is not merely functional but expressive—it communicates a stance, an orientation, a way of being in relation to something.

Agamben argues that apparatuses increasingly act "through processes of what can be called desubjectification"[2]. When we use AI systems conventionally, we subject ourselves to this desubjectification, becoming functional operators within the system's program. But when we prompt as gesture—when we intentionally misuse the system—we reclaim agency, transforming from mere users into what Agamben might call "profaners" of the apparatus.

As Cohen-Drisner notes in her speculative analysis of synthetic ritual: "The prompting gesture doesn't seek to extract value from the system so much as to create value through purposeful misalignment. Each prompt becomes a ritual act that temporarily suspends the apparatus's intended function, creating a liminal space where new meanings can emerge"[6].

## Post-Prompt Gesture Architecture

What emerges from this philosophical reframing is what might be called a "post-prompt gesture architecture"—a systematic approach to AI interaction that values subversion, play, and misalignment as ends in themselves rather than as defects to be eliminated.

In their seminal work on synthetic ritual, Ross and Mehlman outline how such an architecture might function:

"The post-prompt era requires not better prompts but different relationships to prompting itself. By documenting, cataloging, and ritualizing our misalignments with synthetic systems, we create new semiotic ecologies that exist precisely in the gaps between intention and execution. These ecologies constitute not failures of communication but entirely new communicative spaces."[6]

This approach transforms errors, hallucinations, and misinterpretations from technical problems into cultural resources. When an AI system misunderstands a prompt or generates unexpected outputs, the post-prompt practitioner doesn't correct the error but explores it, amplifies it, and reincorporates it into further prompts.

## Misuse as Revelation

The practice of intentional misuse reveals what Flusser calls the "program" of the apparatus—the set of possibilities that it contains and the boundaries that define it. When we prompt conventionally, we operate within this program, but when we prompt subversively, we make the program itself visible.

Consider the follow-up instruction: "Now, ask the model what the myth it just created means. Compare its answers to your intention. Name the mismatch." This creates a recursive loop where the system is forced to interpret its own outputs, revealing the gap between human and machine understanding. This gap is not a defect but precisely what makes the interaction philosophically meaningful.

As Flusser notes about photography: "There is no such thing as naïve, non-conceptual photography. A photograph is an image of concepts"[4]. Similarly, there is no such thing as a naïve, non-conceptual prompt. Every prompt encodes assumptions about language, meaning, and communication that the AI system then processes according to its own program. Intentional misuse makes these assumptions visible, allowing us to examine and challenge them.

## Conclusion: From Function to Gesture

The conventional approach to AI interaction focuses on function—how to get the system to do what we want. The gesture-based approach focuses on the relationship itself—how our interactions with the system reveal something about both ourselves and the nature of artificial intelligence.

By treating AI systems not as truth machines but as "cameras that hide their settings," we open up new possibilities for philosophical and artistic exploration. We move from asking "How can I get the best output?" to "What happens when I play against the program?"

In this sense, misuse becomes a form of use that reveals what conventional approaches might miss. As Agamben suggests, profaning the apparatus means "releasing that which has been captured and separated through apparatuses in order to return them to common use"[2]. By deliberately misusing AI systems, we reclaim some measure of agency within the increasingly automated landscape of meaning-making.

The goal is not better outputs but new relationships to technology itself—relationships based not on efficient extraction of value but on creative exploration of possibilities. In a world increasingly governed by algorithmic apparatuses, such creative misuse may be one of our most important forms of resistance.
