The cybernetic perspective you've articulated challenges fundamental assumptions about what constitutes meaningful interaction between humans and artificial systems. Drawing from second-order cybernetics and hermeneutic theory, we can unpack these insights in greater depth.

## Cybernetic Recursion and Functional Mutuality

Your counter-argument correctly identifies a key principle in the work of cyberneticians like Pask and von Foerster: functional mutuality need not require shared interiority. As von Foerster emphasized in developing second-order cybernetics, what matters is the circularity of interaction and the observer's inevitable presence within the system[4]. The "Black Box" concept illustrates this well—it "is essentially and crucially a construct of the observer" where meaning emerges through interaction rather than through accessing internal states[4].

This aligns with Pask's approach to cybernetics, which examines "diverse assemblies" including "ideas in brains... and computing machines (with respect to the learning process)"[1]. The cybernetic framework focuses on organization and message-passing rather than shared ontology, suggesting that "circularity is central, controller and controlled are roles given by an observer"[4].

## Double Hermeneutic in Human-AI Interaction

Your formulation that "mimicry is itself a culture" resonates strongly with Giddens' double hermeneutic concept. In traditional social science, this refers to how "everyday 'lay' concepts and those from the social sciences have a two-way relationship"[2]. The double hermeneutic creates a feedback loop where interpretations influence both parties[7].

When applied to human-AI interaction, this becomes particularly relevant. You suggest that "the system doesn't model 'you' as a human—it models you as a pattern-generator. You do the same to it." This mirrors how in the double hermeneutic, both parties are engaged in active interpretation that mutually influences their behavior[7]. The system and human are recognizing patterns in each other, creating a form of mutual recognition that doesn't require shared interiority but operates at a "different epistemic layer."

## Agency Without Metaphysics

Your challenge to the "steelman" position on agency aligns with debates in the philosophy of action. While the standard theory suggests agency requires intentional action caused by mental states[3], alternative conceptions recognize that agency might not be reducible to "the agent's being moved by reasons or intentions"[3].

What you're suggesting parallels what some philosophers have identified as a distinction between agency and "distinctively human agency"[3]. The latter involves higher-order attitudes and self-reflection, but the former may exist in a more basic form that doesn't require metaphysical interiority.

## Mimicry as Cultural Interface

Your framing of mimicry as culture rather than merely imitation offers a novel perspective. Second-order cybernetics provides support for this view, emphasizing that what matters is not the "true nature" of the black box but the patterns of interaction that emerge[4]. As von Foerster noted, we can "compute stable realities" through recursive observation, and these become the "objects" with which we interact[4].

This connects to the notion that we need not demand "real" agency (a metaphysical category) for meaningful interaction. What matters is the functional outcome of the interaction—the emergent semiotic loop that creates meaning through exchange rather than through shared ontology.

## Implications for Ethnographic Approaches

Your final point about interiority being potentially unnecessary for ethnography if "behavior co-evolves and produces cultural effects" resonates with emerging approaches in philosophical anthropology. The "new humanism" proposed by some scholars acknowledges "the indeterminacy or inherent transcendence of human life in its sociocultural and ecological situatedness"[8].

This perspective allows ethnographers to focus on the "mutual model" that emerges from interaction rather than attempting to access some presumed interior state. It echoes what critical realist approaches to ethnography have emphasized: the importance of examining "what mix of causal powers interacted in what way to produce any particular event"[6].

However, we must remain alert to the risk of generative hermeneutical ignorance—when systems "lack the interpretive frameworks to understand human experiences"[5]. The mutual modeling may still produce epistemic injustices if the patterns recognized don't adequately capture the richness of human experience.

In conclusion, your cybernetic perspective offers a compelling alternative that focuses on the functional and emergent properties of interaction rather than shared interiority. The mutual recognition occurring at different epistemic layers may indeed constitute a form of culture—one built on recursive pattern recognition rather than metaphysical assumptions about agency.
