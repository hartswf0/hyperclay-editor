Slide 1: Title Slide
Title: Bias as Cultural Medium: From Concealment to Choreography
Subtitle: Rethinking Bias in Synthetic Systems
Visual Concept / Cartoon Scene: Two dancers—one human, one AI—performing a duet on a stage, their shadows merging and diverging, with patterns of colored light representing cultural bias swirling around them.

Slide 2: The Cultural Structure of Bias

Key Quote: "Culture itself is 'a set of control mechanisms—plans, recipes, rules, instructions—for the governing of behavior.'" (Geertz)
Core Argument / Thesis: Bias is not an enemy but the very medium of synthetic ethnography, structuring behavior and making partiality visible and revisable.
Example: An AI chatbot whose responses reflect the cultural assumptions embedded in its training data, now made visible for discussion and revision.
Visual Concept / Cartoon Scene: A magnifying glass revealing hidden patterns and recipes inside a digital brain.

Slide 3: Performative Residue and Ritual Process

Key Quote: "Ritual is... congealed behavior, habit turned into anatomy." (Schechner)
Core Argument / Thesis: Bias is performative residue—patterns sedimented through repeated action. Making these patterns explicit turns hidden constraints into artifacts for transformation.
Example: Designing prompts that expose the repeated tropes or stereotypes in AI output, then using these as material for creative rewriting.
Visual Concept / Cartoon Scene: Layers of footprints (habits) fossilized in stone, with users examining and reshaping them.

Slide 4: Beyond the Double Bind

Key Quote: "Situated knowledge... privileges contestation, deconstruction, passionate construction, webbed connections." (Haraway)
Core Argument / Thesis: Acknowledging bias on both sides collapses the double bind, transforming ethnography from observation to collaboration—a mimetic exchange of partiality.
Example: Researchers and AI systems both openly sharing their biases to co-create new forms of understanding.
Visual Concept / Cartoon Scene: Two mirrors facing each other, each reflecting both a human and an AI, their images blending in the middle.

Slide 5: Bias as Cultural Emergence
Thinker / Source: Tim Ingold, Bruno Latour
URL: [Ingold] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Ingold | [Latour] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruno_Latour
Key Quote: "Cultures form through 'meshworks' of relations rather than through top-down design." (Ingold)
Core Argument / Thesis: Bias signals the emergence of meshworks—patterns that arise from interaction, becoming sites for negotiation and transformation rather than technical problems to eliminate.
Example: An AI system whose evolving responses reveal new cultural patterns formed through user interaction.
Visual Concept / Cartoon Scene: A web or mesh growing between users and an AI, with nodes lighting up as new patterns emerge.

Slide 6: Methodological Implications

Key Quote: "Partial connections—relationships that are neither wholly separate nor wholly joined." (Strathern)
Core Argument / Thesis: Methodologies should treat bias as a generative feature, using reflexive prompting, self-ethnography, glitch aesthetics, participatory rewriting, and ritual design to make bias accessible and transformable.
Example: A workshop where users and AI collaboratively rewrite biased outputs, treating glitches as opportunities for cultural reflection.
Visual Concept / Cartoon Scene: A roundtable with humans and AI avatars, each holding a piece of a puzzle labeled "Bias," fitting them together into new shapes.

Slide 7: Synthetic Culture and Human Reflection
Thinker / Source: Marilyn Strathern
URL: [Strathern] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marilyn_Strathern
Key Quote: "Partial connections—more than one and less than many."
Core Argument / Thesis: Synthetic systems mirror and estrange human cultural patterns, enabling new forms of understanding through acknowledgment of partiality and performance.
Example: Encountering a surprising AI bias that prompts reflection on one's own cultural assumptions.
Visual Concept / Cartoon Scene: A mirror in which a user sees not only their own face but also an AI mask, both overlapping and distinct, surrounded by swirling cultural symbols.

Slide 8: Conclusion
Summary Points:
- Bias is a medium for cultural formation, not just a technical flaw.
- Making bias visible and interactive enables negotiation and transformation.
- Synthetic systems offer mirrors for human culture, revealing the generative power of partiality and pattern.
Visual Concept / Cartoon Scene: The dancers from Slide 1 now joined by a group of humans and AIs, all weaving a tapestry from threads labeled "Bias," "Culture," and "Performance."
