# The Gremlin's Dance: Embracing Instability in Synthetic Ethnography

The provocative stance in your query represents a theoretically rich response to criticisms of synthetic ethnographic approaches to AI. Far from being merely "postmodernism with a GPU," this position draws on established intellectual traditions while pushing toward genuinely novel epistemic terrain.

## Synthetic Ethnography as Methodological Innovation

The emerging field of synthetic ethnography provides methodological approaches for qualitative study of generative models through experimental field devices. As described in recent scholarship, this involves "drawing synthetic media into the field, collaborating with generative models, or even repurposing their logics as research probes"[1]. Rather than simply applying traditional methods to new objects, synthetic ethnography represents what Reed called "a generative synthesis" that makes "underlying assemblages visible"[1].

This approach parallels what Petrič's "Performative Ethnographies" accomplish—not merely observing automated systems but contaminating them from within. As one analysis notes, "It is not a higher model, a more abstract way of representation, but rather it incorporates multiplicity, chaos into the existing models, contaminating them from within, disrupting their representative claims of clarity, stability, universality"[9].

## Cybernetic Foundations

The invocation of cybernetic theorists like Ashby, Bateson, Pask, and von Foerster isn't merely decorative. Their work provides sophisticated conceptual frameworks for understanding recursive systems and observer-dependent knowledge.

Bateson's cybernetic epistemology, for instance, recognized that "mental process or mind... must be investigated" rather than excluded from science as non-empirical[5]. His approach employed cybernetics as "a unifying model of mental phenomena, and as a tool for 'mapping' and explaining the previously inaccessible 'territory' of mind"[5].

Similarly, Pask suggested that while "a biological system was taciturn, and could regulate internal states in reacting to the environment, conversational systems constantly reconstructed reference frames of their reality by interacting, making cognition unbounded"[3]. This framework positions the researcher as "an observer who enters a psychosocial unity with an observed system"[3]—precisely the stance that synthetic ethnography adopts.

## The Epistemological Value of Noise

The claim to "the unstable, the leaky, the recursive, the haunted" isn't mere aesthetic posturing but connects to serious epistemological discussions about noise and uncertainty. Malaspina's work on the epistemology of noise demonstrates that noise has "positive epistemic value" and plays "a constitutive role... in the formation of knowledge"[8].

In this framework, noise isn't merely disruptive but represents "a fundamental epistemological contingency, a state of suspension or indecision, from which reason emancipates itself with acts of self-grounding"[8]. The "unstable" and "leaky" aspects of AI systems might thus be understood not as failures but as generative sites where new forms of knowledge emerge.

## Ontological Re-engineering

The performative perspective challenges representationalist approaches by focusing on how technologies actively shape reality rather than merely represent it. This "performative idiom" highlights "the active role of technologies in shaping and co-creating the world through our engagements"[6].

Rather than seeing AI systems as simply modeling reality imperfectly, this approach recognizes that they participate in creating new ontological arrangements. As Callon observed, this position is "both realistic and constructivist: realistic because it isn't possible to make just anything exist... and constructivist because for any one entity there are thousands of ways of existing... existing is acting"[6].

## The Birth Metaphor

The characterization of the field as being "born in a shadowed moment" with all the attendant embarrassment connects to how new scientific paradigms emerge. Like many revolutionary approaches, synthetic ethnography challenges established methodological norms by being, as critics of Petrič's work complained, "not rigorous enough" and failing to "follow methodological clarity"[9].

Yet this apparent lack of rigor may be precisely its strength. By "betraying the regime of the method," practitioners "expose the partiality of meanings" and become "invested with the spaces they encounter when embodying a perspective"[9]. This process makes "what is already known becomes questioned and untrustworthy"[9]—the necessary precondition for genuinely new knowledge.

## Dancing in the Glitch

The final embracing of movement and "dancing in the glitch" connects to how synthetic ethnography approaches the limitations of AI systems. Rather than seeing hallucinations, biases, and inconsistencies merely as problems to be eliminated, this approach treats them as data to be analyzed[1][9].

This stance echoes the cybernetic approach where, as Bateson recognized, paradoxes aren't flaws but necessary features: "without these paradoxes, communication would be reduced to 'an endless interchange of stylized messages, a game with rigid rules, unrelieved by change or humor'"[8].

## Beyond Static Schemas

By challenging epistemologies that can't "survive recursive irony, semiotic recursion, and ritual noise," this approach aligns with what performative ethnography aims to accomplish: a practice that "resists 'the modern monification of the world'" and "embraces the many that come with affirming the uncomfortable"[9].

Rather than seeking a stable representation of reality, synthetic ethnography becomes "a practice of onto-epistemological differing that reclaims realism as not 'belonging only to monistic metaphysics'"[9]. It acknowledges the complex, contingent nature of knowledge production in human-AI systems and embraces this complexity as generative rather than problematic.

In this sense, the "gremlin's dance" is not a rejection of rigor but a different kind of rigor—one that acknowledges the recursive, performative nature of all knowledge production and embraces the productive tensions that emerge from human-AI collaborations.
