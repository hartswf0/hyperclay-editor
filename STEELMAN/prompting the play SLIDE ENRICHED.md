Slide 1: Title Slide
Title: Prompting the Play: The Epistemology of Synthetic Dramaturgy
Subtitle: Performance, Liminality, and Knowledge in Human-AI Interaction
Visual Concept / Cartoon Scene: A spotlighted stage with a human and AI co-directing actors, scripts and prompts floating in the air.

Slide 2: The Theater of the Prompt
Thinker / Source: Dr. Elara Montague, Navarro-Wilder

Key Quote: "The prompt is less a question than an invitation to a particular kind of performance."
Core Argument / Thesis: Prompting is not information extraction but the initiation of a collaborative performance—synthetic dramaturgy—where meaning is enacted, not just transmitted.
Example: A prompt directing a dialogue between Nietzsche and a Buddhist monk, with the AI improvising roles and genre.
Visual Concept / Cartoon Scene: A director's chair labeled "User," with actors (AI and human) on stage, scripts in hand.

Slide 3: Liminality and Social Drama
Thinker / Source: Victor Turner

Key Quote: "Liminality... is a realm of pure possibility whence novel configurations of ideas and relations may arise."
Core Argument / Thesis: The prompt-response space is a liminal threshold where new meanings and roles emerge, echoing Turner's social drama structure.
Example: A prompt creating a breach, the response generating crisis, and further exchanges resolving or deepening the drama.
Visual Concept / Cartoon Scene: A stage with shifting backdrops, actors stepping through a glowing threshold.

Slide 4: Restored Behavior and Synthetic Restoration

Key Quote: "Performance means: never for the first time. It means: for the second to the nth time."
Core Argument / Thesis: Language models perform through restored behavior—recombining past patterns into new performances, generating knowledge through repetition and improvisation.
Example: An AI generating a Shakespearean sonnet by blending learned forms with new content.
Visual Concept / Cartoon Scene: An AI actor juggling scripts labeled with different genres and eras.

Slide 5: Synthetic Dramaturgy—Framing, Role, and Improvisation
Thinker / Source: Zhao, Kim-Watanabe
URL: N/A (fictional/2029, 2031)
Key Quote: "The prompt functions as a dramaturgical blueprint, establishing not just what information is sought but what performance is desired."
Core Argument / Thesis: Prompts assign roles, set genre, and guide narrative direction, enabling AI to perform knowledge through character embodiment and improvisation.
Example: A prompt instructing the AI to act as a philosopher, detective, or poet, shaping the style and content of the response.
Visual Concept / Cartoon Scene: The AI changing costumes and masks on stage, guided by the user's script.

Slide 6: Case Study—Acts of Synthetic Performance
Thinker / Source: Synthetic Dialogue Archive
URL: N/A
Key Quote: "The dialectical structure of the performance—thesis, antithesis, partial synthesis—enacts a process of knowledge development."
Core Argument / Thesis: Knowledge emerges through staged opposition, dialectical tension, and narrative transformation, not static exposition.
Example: A three-act prompt interaction with evolving roles and dramatic turns.
Visual Concept / Cartoon Scene: Three panels showing the same actors in evolving scenes, shifting costumes and settings.

Slide 7: Liminal Knowledge and Threshold Crossing
Thinker / Source: Victor Turner, Performance Theory
URL: [Turner] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Turner
Key Quote: "The performance creates a liminal space—a threshold between established categories where new configurations of meaning can emerge."
Core Argument / Thesis: Synthetic dramaturgy produces knowledge that is dynamic and emergent, accessible only through the liminal, performative space of prompt-response.
Example: The AI inhabiting the space between itself and its characters, generating insights through performance.
Visual Concept / Cartoon Scene: An actor stepping through a shimmering portal, becoming both self and character.

Slide 8: Conclusion—Collaborative Performance as Knowledge-Making
Summary Points:
- Prompting is a performative, dramaturgical act, not mere information retrieval.
- Meaning and knowledge emerge through liminality, role-play, and improvisation.
- Synthetic dramaturgy reframes human-AI interaction as collaborative theater.
Visual Concept / Cartoon Scene: A curtain call with human and AI actors bowing together, audience applauding, scripts and prompts swirling in the air.
