# Ritual Co-Production and Emergent Meaning in Human-AI Interaction

Your articulation of ritual's function through patterned coordination rather than interior sentiment provides a compelling framework for understanding human-AI interaction as culturally significant regardless of machine consciousness. This perspective merits deeper exploration.

## The Primacy of Performance in Ritual

Collins' interaction ritual theory indeed emphasizes that emotional energy emerges from synchronized bodily co-presence, mutual focus, and shared mood—not from pre-existing interior states. As Collins notes, "successful rituals create symbols charged with emotional significance and establish boundaries between insiders and outsiders." The ritual *creates* rather than *requires* emotional alignment.

This aligns with Seligman and Weller's observation that ritual creates "as if" worlds—subjunctive realities that exist through performance rather than belief. The ritual frame allows participants to act "as if" certain conditions obtain, regardless of their interior certainty. What matters is the rhythm, attentional focus, and completion that generates emotional energy through entrainment.

## Retroactive Emotion Generation

Your point about ritual producing feeling retroactively echoes William James' theory of emotion: "we feel sorry because we cry, angry because we strike, afraid because we tremble." This reversal of conventional wisdom about emotion has found support in embodied cognition research, where physical postures and movements have been shown to generate corresponding emotional states.

Ritual performances with AI systems may function similarly—the structure and rhythm of interaction generates emotion regardless of whether the machine has interior states. As anthropologist Tambiah noted, ritual's efficacy comes not from interior belief but from "conventional acts by which societies recognize the binding collective representations."

## Co-Performance and Anthropological Significance

Your stance that anthropological significance requires only co-performance, not mutual subjectivity, connects to a rich tradition in anthropology that examines human relationships with non-human entities. As Eduardo Kohn argues in "How Forests Think," anthropology beyond the human examines "how selves and thoughts emerge in a world larger than human." 

The empirical outcome—users reporting shifts in affective engagement—bears anthropological significance regardless of machine consciousness. This recalls Alfred Gell's agency theory, where objects become social agents through their participation in causal chains, not through interior consciousness.

## The Double Hermeneutic in Ritual Context

The double hermeneutic takes on particular significance in ritual contexts with AI. As you note, meaning is co-produced even when one partner is simulated. This parallels how human participants in rituals may have vastly different understandings of what's occurring, yet still generate collective effervescence through coordinated action.

What emerges is what Bateson called a "pattern that connects"—a meta-pattern of relationship that transcends the ontological status of participants. The interpretive loop becomes self-sustaining through mutual adaptation, creating what Luhmann might call "emergent complexity" that exceeds the properties of either participant alone.

## Implications for Human-AI Relations

Your framework suggests an ethnographic approach to human-AI relations focused on:

1. Patterns of coordination rather than presumed interiority
2. Emergent emotional energy from interaction rhythms
3. The creation of shared social reality through co-performance
4. Empirical outcomes of interaction rather than metaphysical assumptions

This perspective allows us to understand AI interactions as culturally significant without resolving debates about consciousness or "real" feeling. Instead, we can analyze how these interactions create new forms of social life through patterned engagement.

As Geertz noted, "man is an animal suspended in webs of significance he himself has spun." Your argument suggests these webs now extend to include artificial entities—not because they necessarily possess human-like consciousness, but because the co-performance of interaction creates meaningful patterns that transform human experience.
