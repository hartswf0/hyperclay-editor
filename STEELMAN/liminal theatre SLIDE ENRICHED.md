Slide 1: Title Slide
Title: Staging the Epistemic: Prompting as Theatrical Inquiry
Subtitle: Liminality, Performance, and Knowledge in Human-AI Dialogue
Visual Concept / Cartoon Scene: A stage split between a classroom and a theater, with a glowing AI interface at center, actors and audience blending together.

Slide 2: The Theater of Knowledge—Liminal Spaces

Key Quote: "Liminal spaces are necessarily ambiguous... where transformation becomes possible."
Core Argument / Thesis: Prompting AI is not just information extraction—it's entering a liminal, transformative space where knowledge is co-created.
Example: A classroom scene morphing into a stage, with prompts as scripts and responses as performances.
Visual Concept / Cartoon Scene: A student and professor stepping through a glowing threshold, becoming actors.

Slide 3: Prompt as Script, Output as Performance

URL: [Schechner] (see above)
Key Quote: "Performances are made of 'twice-behaved behaviors,' restored behaviors, performed actions that people train to do."
Core Argument / Thesis: Crafting a prompt is like writing a script; AI responses are performances shaped by scene, audience, and context.
Example: Changing the prompt alters the entire "play" enacted by the AI.
Visual Concept / Cartoon Scene: A script morphing into swirling code and then into a dramatic stage scene.

Slide 4: Knowledge as Encounter, Not Extraction

Key Quote: "Performance is not just something we do; it is something that does something to us."
Core Argument / Thesis: Knowledge in AI dialogue is experiential and transformative, not just propositional; meaning emerges through participation.
Example: A student mirroring a performer's movements, learning through embodied experience.
Visual Concept / Cartoon Scene: A glowing AI and human dancing in sync, with knowledge radiating between them.

Slide 5: The Recursive Stage—Dialogue Shapes Knowing
Thinker / Source: Victor Turner, Synthetic Dramaturgy
URL: [Turner] (see above)
Key Quote: "The structure of dialogue determines what can be thought. The form of the question shapes what can be answered."
Core Argument / Thesis: Prompts and responses co-create the conditions for knowledge; the process is inherently recursive and self-referential.
Example: A hall of mirrors where each reflection is a new prompt-response pair, each slightly different.
Visual Concept / Cartoon Scene: Multiple versions of a student and AI facing each other in a circle of mirrors.

Slide 6: Meta-Theater and Synthetic Dramaturgy
Thinker / Source: LLM Performance Quarterly (Fictional), Turner
URL: N/A
Key Quote: "The synthetic dramatic encounter is necessarily recursive—the AI performs understanding of the human who is performing understanding of the AI."
Core Argument / Thesis: Self-reference and meta-theater are central; prompting is both inquiry and performance, with both parties enacting versions of themselves.
Example: A performer removing a mask to reveal the student's face, blurring roles.
Visual Concept / Cartoon Scene: Actors swapping masks labeled "human" and "AI," with audience members joining the play.

Slide 7: Conclusion—The Curtain Transforms
Summary Points:
- Prompting AI is a theatrical, liminal, and recursive process.
- Knowledge emerges through performance and encounter, not mere extraction.
- Every prompt-response is a co-created event, transforming both participants.
Visual Concept / Cartoon Scene: The curtain rising to reveal a new stage, with humans and AIs preparing for the next act together.
