Slide 1: Title Slide
Title: Epistemic Masks and the Ritual of Imperfect Knowledge
Subtitle: Trust, Pseudonymity, and Performance in Synthetic Scholarship
Visual Concept / Cartoon Scene: A stage with multiple figures (human and AI) wearing different masks, each holding scrolls labeled "Knowledge," with the audience peering through magnifying glasses.

Slide 2: The Paradox of Synthetic Authority
Thinker / Source: Donna Haraway, Ethnography of the Prompt (2033)
URL: [Haraway] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donna_Haraway
Key Quote: "When knowledge emerges from systems with no biography, no institutional affiliation, and no stable identity, how might trust be established?"
Core Argument / Thesis: Synthetic scholarship disrupts traditional anchors of epistemic trust, requiring new practices to establish credibility and meaning.
Example: AI-generated research articles published under pseudonyms, lacking institutional credentials but annotated for transparency.
Visual Concept / Cartoon Scene: A faceless scholar presenting a paper, with a shadowy crowd debating its trustworthiness.

Slide 3: The Myth of Transparent Authorship
Thinker / Source: Donna Haraway, Situated Knowledges
URL: [Haraway] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Situated_knowledges
Key Quote: "Objectivity turns out to be about particular and specific embodiment... not about the false vision promising transcendence of all limits and responsibility."
Core Argument / Thesis: The ideal of transparent authorship conceals the partial, situated nature of all knowledge—AI-generated texts make this visible through distributed authorship.
Example: A synthetic essay annotated with training data sources, model parameters, and known biases.
Visual Concept / Cartoon Scene: A tapestry woven from many hands, each labeled with a different "source," forming a single narrative.

Slide 4: Synthetic Pseudonymity—The Mask as Method
Thinker / Source: Jorge Luis Borges, Ethnography of the Prompt (2033)
URL: [Borges] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jorge_Luis_Borges
Key Quote: "The mask is not a deception but a declaration of positionality—an acknowledgment that all knowledge emerges from somewhere."
Core Argument / Thesis: Synthetic pseudonymity uses explicit masks and fictional identities to acknowledge the constructed, distributed nature of synthetic knowledge.
Example: AI-generated encyclopedias with fictional contributors, each with a declared perspective and limitations.
Visual Concept / Cartoon Scene: A masquerade ball where each mask is labeled with a different "epistemic position."

Slide 5: Ritual Failure and the Value of Hallucination

URL: (see above)
Key Quote: "Only partial perspective promises objective vision."
Core Argument / Thesis: Synthetic "hallucinations" can be reframed as ritualized failures—making the process of knowledge construction visible and trustworthy through explicit acknowledgment of error and uncertainty.
Example: An AI system that highlights speculative statements and invites user correction, rather than presenting all output as fact.
Visual Concept / Cartoon Scene: A spotlight illuminating both the correct and incorrect answers on a blackboard, with a teacher (AI) inviting the class to annotate.

Slide 6: Epistemic Theater—Performance as Knowledge Production
Thinker / Source: Jorge Luis Borges, Ethnography of the Prompt (2033)
URL: (see above)
Key Quote: "Meaning emerges not just from text but from context—from the relationship between text and reader, author and audience, claim and situation."
Core Argument / Thesis: Epistemic theater treats knowledge production as performance, making visible the constraints, fictions, and negotiations involved.
Example: A synthetic text presented as a staged debate, with footnotes and counter-voices embedded throughout.
Visual Concept / Cartoon Scene: A theater stage with actors (AI and human) debating, surrounded by floating footnotes and commentary bubbles.

Slide 7: Practices of Self-Annotation—Margins, Redactions, Counter-Voices
Thinker / Source: Donna Haraway, Ethnography of the Prompt (2033)
URL: (see above)
Key Quote: "The knowing self is partial in all its guises, never finished, whole, simply there and original; it is always constructed and stitched together imperfectly."
Core Argument / Thesis: Self-annotation—marginalia, confidence levels, counter-voices—creates transparency and trust by revealing internal dialogue and uncertainty.
Example: A document with highlighted sections labeled "high confidence," "speculative," and "possible hallucination," plus margin notes from multiple perspectives.
Visual Concept / Cartoon Scene: A scroll with many colored sticky notes, each representing a different voice or confidence level.

Slide 8: Conclusion—Toward a Ritual Epistemology
Thinker / Source: Ethnography of the Prompt (2033)
URL: (see above)
Key Quote: "The mask is ethical precisely when it declares itself as mask, when it makes visible rather than conceals the conditions of its own production."
Core Argument / Thesis: In a world of synthetic scholarship, trust and validity arise from ritualized transparency, explicit acknowledgment of limits, and participatory meaning-making—not from appeals to authenticity alone.
Example: Synthetic knowledge platforms that require every output to include a "mask statement"—a declaration of its synthetic, partial, and situated nature.
Visual Concept / Cartoon Scene: A ritual circle where each participant (human and AI) removes their mask to reveal a unique, glowing symbol of their epistemic position.
