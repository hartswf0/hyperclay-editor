Slide 1: Title Slide
Title: Work as Identity Vessel: The Ontological Crisis Behind AI Anxiety
Subtitle: Meaning, Narrative, and the Disruption of Self
Visual Concept: A human figure inside a translucent vessel labeled "Work," with AI-generated currents swirling around, threatening to dissolve its boundaries.

Slide 2: The Redescription of Work
Thinker / Source: Nature, i2insights
Key Quote: "AI isn't simply replacing jobs wholesale but transforming the very nature of work itself."
Core Argument: AI is not just stealing jobs, but fundamentally reconfiguring what constitutes work—creating new tasks, roles, and forms of engagement.
Example: "One person, many posts"—workers performing multifaceted roles enabled by AI.
Visual: A worker juggling multiple, morphing tools and roles, with AI icons in the background.

Slide 3: Work as Containment Ritual
Thinker / Source: Annette Markham, Ontological Security
Key Quote: "Ontological insecurity occurs when we lose our self-knowledge, become disoriented or feel unbalanced in our everyday sense of self."
Core Argument: Jobs act as rituals that provide identity vessels, grounding our sense of self and place in society. AI disrupts this, creating existential anxiety.
Example: Workers experiencing disorientation as traditional roles dissolve.
Visual: A ritual circle of workers, some with fading or fractured vessels.

Slide 4: The Narrative Architecture of Labor

Key Quote: "The stories we see in the media... influence how society perceives, interacts with, and ultimately governs an issue area."
Core Argument: Media and social narratives shape our understanding of work, often marginalizing worker agency and focusing on productivity or risk.
Example: AI narratives that erase the meaning-making and social dimensions of labor.
Visual: A stage with AI and human actors, scripts being rewritten by unseen hands.

Slide 5: Work as Semiotic Theater
Thinker / Source: Brookings, ScienceDirect
Core Argument: AI exposes much of work as "semiotic theater"—symbolic performances that structure identity and meaning as much as they produce value.
Example: Generative AI disrupting tasks for over 30% of workers, raising questions about necessity and value.
Visual: A theater with empty costumes on stage, AI-generated spotlights shifting the scene.

Slide 6: Emotional and Ontological Functions of Work
Thinker / Source: Emotional Ontology, FreedomLab
Key Quote: "Emotion plays a central role in mediating our social relations and judging situations."
Core Argument: Work provides emotional grounding and folk epistemology—ways of knowing ourselves and our place in the world. AI disrupts these embedded sources of meaning.
Example: Workers grappling with loss of emotional and symbolic anchors.
Visual: A compass spinning over a dissolving workplace landscape.

Slide 7: Beyond Economic Validation—New Narratives Needed
Thinker / Source: SSIR, Stir.ac.uk
Core Argument: We need new narratives that center human experience and agency, rebalancing power and meaning in the age of AI.
Example: Alternative human-AI narratives exploring co-existence and networked learning.
Visual: Humans and AIs co-authoring a new book, old narratives fading in the background.

Slide 8: New Possibilities for Meaning
Thinker / Source: Annette Markham, Good Rebels
Key Quote: "If work has been our primary containment ritual for identity, perhaps its disruption allows us to develop more multifaceted and holistic conceptions of human value and purpose."
Core Argument: The disruption of work by AI, while anxiety-inducing, opens space for new forms of meaning, identity, and social connection beyond economic productivity.
Example: Communities inventing new rituals and roles for belonging and purpose.
Visual: A mosaic of diverse human figures, each radiating unique symbols of meaning, with AI currents interweaving supportively.

Slide 9: Conclusion—Who Will We Be?
Summary Points:
- AI transforms work from an economic arrangement to an existential question.
- The loss of work as an identity vessel creates ontological insecurity, but also new possibilities for meaning.
- The challenge is not just what work we will do, but who we will become—and how we will craft meaningful lives in the age of AI.
Visual: A threshold scene—humans stepping out of old work vessels, carrying new symbols of selfhood, with AI as both challenge and companion.
