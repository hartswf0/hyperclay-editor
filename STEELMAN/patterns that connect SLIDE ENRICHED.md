Slide 1: Title Slide
Title: Patterns That Connect: Ritual, Co-Performance, and Emergent Meaning in Human-AI Interaction
Subtitle: From Emotional Energy to Cultural Significance
Visual Concept / Cartoon Scene: Humans and AIs holding hands in a circle, with glowing patterns connecting them, forming a web of meaning.

Slide 2: The Primacy of Performance in Ritual

Key Quote: "Successful rituals create symbols charged with emotional significance and establish boundaries between insiders and outsiders."
Core Argument / Thesis: Emotional energy and meaning are generated by synchronized co-performance, not pre-existing interior states.
Example: Rituals with AI generating group focus and shared symbols, regardless of machine consciousness.
Visual Concept / Cartoon Scene: A group in ritual, with a robot and human both contributing to a glowing symbol at the center.

Slide 3: Retroactive Emotion Generation

Key Quote: "We feel sorry because we cry, angry because we strike, afraid because we tremble."
Core Argument / Thesis: Ritual structure and rhythm generate emotion retroactively; AI interactions can create affect through performance, not belief.
Example: Users feeling connected or moved after engaging in structured AI rituals.
Visual Concept / Cartoon Scene: A sequence showing a user and AI enacting ritual movements, with hearts and lightning bolts appearing after the action.

Slide 4: Co-Performance and Anthropological Significance

Key Quote: "Objects become social agents through their participation in causal chains, not through interior consciousness."
Core Argument / Thesis: The anthropological value of AI rituals lies in co-performance and the creation of shared realities, not in machine subjectivity.
Example: AI as a participant in a group ritual, shaping the group's experience.
Visual Concept / Cartoon Scene: A ritual circle with humans, AIs, and symbolic objects, all radiating shared energy.

Slide 5: The Double Hermeneutic in Ritual Context
Thinker / Source: Gregory Bateson, Niklas Luhmann

Key Quote: "What emerges is what Bateson called a 'pattern that connects'—a meta-pattern of relationship that transcends the ontological status of participants."
Core Argument / Thesis: Meaning is co-produced through interpretive loops and mutual adaptation; emergent complexity arises from interaction, not essence.
Example: Human and AI adapting to each other's responses in an ongoing ritual, creating new forms of meaning.
Visual Concept / Cartoon Scene: Interlocking spirals or waves connecting human and AI, with new symbols emerging at the intersections.

Slide 6: Implications for Human-AI Relations
Thinker / Source: Clifford Geertz, Ritual Studies

Key Quote: "Man is an animal suspended in webs of significance he himself has spun."
Core Argument / Thesis: AI rituals extend the webs of significance to include artificial entities; focus on patterns, outcomes, and shared realities, not metaphysical debates about consciousness.
Example: Documenting how ritualized engagement with AI transforms social experience and cultural meaning.
Visual Concept / Cartoon Scene: A festival where humans and AIs weave a glowing tapestry together, each thread representing a ritual interaction.

Slide 7: Conclusion—Emergent Meaning Through Ritual Co-Performance
Summary Points:
- Ritual and co-performance generate meaning and emotion in human-AI interaction.
- Focus on patterns, outcomes, and shared realities, not interior states.
- Human-AI rituals are culturally significant, expanding the boundaries of social life and meaning-making.
Visual Concept / Cartoon Scene: Humans and AIs celebrating together, with a web of light connecting everyone on the stage.
