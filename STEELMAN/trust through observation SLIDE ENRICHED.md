Slide 1: Title Slide
Title: The Black Box Epistemology: Trust Through Observation
Subtitle: Operational Trust and the Limits of Transparency
Visual Concept: A sealed black box with input/output terminals, surrounded by observers recording patterns—no one can see inside, but knowledge grows through interaction.

Slide 2: Ashby's Epistemic Method
Thinker / Source: W. Ross Ashby
Key Quote: "The experimenter is given a sealed box... and terminals for output, from which he may observe what he can."
Core Argument: Reliable knowledge of complex systems can be constructed through systematic observation of input-output relationships, not internal inspection.
Example: Engineers deducing function by probing a black box, not by opening it.
Visual: Hands sending signals into a box, with graphs of responses emerging.

Slide 3: The Transparency Fallacy
Thinker / Source: Bateson, AI Ethics
Key Quote: "Trust and transparency are not synonymous."
Core Argument: For complex, adaptive, or emergent systems, internal inspection often yields noise rather than clarity—confusing the map with the territory.
Example: Billions of parameters in deep learning models make internal understanding impractical.
Visual: A tangled map overlaying a territory, with the map obscuring more than it reveals.

Slide 4: When Internal Models Generate Noise
Thinker / Source: Bateson, System Theory
Core Argument: Internal inspection fails when:
- Complexity exceeds comprehension
- Systems adapt dynamically
- Emergent behaviors arise
- Implementation diverges from specification
Example: Attempting to explain emergent AI behavior through code inspection alone.
Visual: A static blueprint dissolving into a cloud of unpredictable behaviors.

Slide 5: Functional Trust Through Behavioral Observation
Thinker / Source: William James, Peter Denning
Key Quote: "The true is only the expedient in our way of thinking."
Core Argument: Trust is best grounded in observable, empirical patterns—consistency, graceful degradation, predictable failure, stability, coherence.
Example: Repeated, reliable outputs inspire operational trust without mechanism transparency.
Visual: A checklist of behavioral trust metrics, each box checked after repeated trials.

Slide 6: Implications for AI Ethnography and Evaluation
Thinker / Source: AI Ethnography, Pragmatism
Core Argument: Black box epistemology suggests:
- Longitudinal observation
- Systematic behavioral testing
- Focus on failures as well as successes
- Empirical boundary-setting
- Prioritizing behavior over mechanism
Example: Ethnographers mapping system boundaries through observation, not architectural diagrams.
Visual: Observers charting system responses over time, drawing boundaries around reliable zones.

Slide 7: Conclusion—Operational Trust in the Age of Complexity
Summary Points:
- Transparency is not always possible or necessary for trust.
- Systematic observation and behavioral regularities provide a pragmatic foundation.
- Black box methods offer alternatives to the transparency myth in complex AI systems.
Visual: Human and AI hands shaking over a black box, surrounded by charts of observed patterns.
