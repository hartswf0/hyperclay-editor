# AI and Democracy: Accelerant, Not Origin of Democratic Decline

The perspective offered in the query provides a crucial counterpoint to mainstream narratives about AI's threat to democracy. Evidence from recent research and global trends supports this "gremlin take" that AI is accelerating existing patterns rather than creating entirely new democratic challenges.

## Preexisting Democratic Decline: AI as Scaling Agent

Multiple sources confirm that democratic backsliding was well underway before widespread AI deployment. As noted by researchers, "over the last 10 years there has been a worldwide decline of democracy, notably in civil liberties, the functioning of government, the electoral process, and pluralism"[7]. This decline predates the widespread adoption of generative AI technologies.

The causal relationship between AI and democratic erosion appears to run counter to common assumptions. Data shows that "Countries are more likely to buy surveillance AI after periods of domestic unrest" and "countries also appear more likely to import such software when their democratic institutions or civil liberties have eroded"[6]. This suggests that democratic decline often precedes AI adoption rather than results from it.

What AI systems have done is make existing surveillance and information manipulation capabilities more efficient and accessible. AI-powered surveillance provides "governments more efficient ways of keeping tabs on the public" and allows "frail non-democratic governments" to "detect and track individuals and deter civil disobedience before it begins"[6]. The technology scales existing desires for control rather than creating them.

## The Authoritarian Tendency Was Already in Place

The authoritarian use of AI reflects preexisting governance patterns. China's role as "an exporter of digital authoritarianism and a major digital infrastructure provider to developing and authoritarian states"[2] demonstrates how AI integrates into existing authoritarian frameworks rather than creating them anew.

This trend extends beyond explicitly authoritarian states. Even in democratic contexts, AI systems often reinforce existing power structures, as seen in how "predictive policing algorithms disproportionately target historically marginalized communities"[9]. These systems don't introduce bias—they scale and automate biases already present in governance.

The query's assertion that "the tools aren't turning authoritarian—the world already was" finds support in how readily various governments have adopted surveillance technologies. The observation that weak democracies exhibited "backsliding—a dismantling of democratic institutions and movement toward autocracy" regardless of whether surveillance technology originated from China or the democratic United States[6] points to underlying governance tendencies rather than a technological determinism.

## Diverting Accountability Through Technology Criticism

By fixating on AI as the primary threat to democracy, we risk shifting accountability away from political institutions. As one analysis notes, "Technologists are no longer just innovators—they are becoming political actors"[8], but this framing can obscure how political systems themselves have abdicated responsibility.

Tech companies exploit this dynamic by deploying "ethics frameworks to avoid statutory regulation" which serve "as a defense mechanism for criticism from wider society"[10]. This self-regulation becomes "a direct attempt to avoid any real accountability to the public"[10], allowing both technology companies and political institutions to evade responsibility for how these systems are deployed.

The focus on technical solutions rather than political accountability is evident in how discussions center on AI capabilities rather than the institutional choices that deploy them. Research indicates that most "government AI systems surveyed across the globe have [very few] meaningful transparency measures in place"[9], reflecting a political choice to implement these systems without democratic safeguards.

## The Readiness of Institutions to Adopt Control Technologies

Perhaps the most troubling insight is how eagerly democratic institutions have embraced AI systems that enhance control. This raises the query's critical question: "Why were our institutions so ready to integrate it like this?"

The answer may lie in what one source calls the creation of an "algocracy"—rule by algorithms—where "the public has little understanding of how decisions affecting them are made"[9]. This shift represents not a technological inevitability but a governance preference for systems that reduce citizen input while maintaining the appearance of procedural legitimacy.

The transition to "a new form of governance where technical experts and private contractors have enormous influence over public policy implementation"[9] reflects institutional choices to delegate authority away from democratic processes. "Decision-making shifts from public to private hands"[8] not because AI forced this change, but because institutions were already inclined toward it.

## Beyond Technological Determinism

The perspective offered in the query challenges us to move beyond technological determinism in addressing AI's impact on democracy. Rather than treating AI as an external force reshaping society, we must recognize it as a tool being deployed within existing power structures and according to existing governance preferences.

This framing shifts our focus from regulating the technology itself to examining the political choices that determine how it's used. As one researcher notes, technologies built "for profit, efficiency, competitive advantage, or time spent online are not designed to safeguard or strengthen democracy"[4]. The issue isn't just the technology but the values that shape its development and deployment.

By understanding AI as an accelerant rather than a cause of democratic decline, we can better address the actual challenges facing democratic governance. This means focusing not just on algorithmic transparency or ethical AI deployment, but on strengthening democratic institutions against authoritarian tendencies that exist independently of the technology.

In this light, AI becomes not merely a threat to be regulated but a mirror reflecting our existing governance patterns back at us—making visible the authoritarian tendencies that were already present but perhaps less apparent before they were scaled by algorithmic efficiency.
