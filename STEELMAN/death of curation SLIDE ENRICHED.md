Key Quote: "As power shifts to consumers, curation moves out of the hands of professionals and into communities, platforms and algorithms."

Key Quote: "Value is no longer in the artifact but in the social ritual of attention."

Example: Viral challenges and memes that gain cultural significance through shared performance and repetition.

Key Quote: "The correction to the algorithmic over-correction, a revival of human judgment in response to computational flattening."
Core Argument / Thesis: As algorithmic curation plateaus, there is a resurgence of human judgment and community-based recommendation, blending the best of both worlds.
Example: The resurgence of platforms like Tumblr, where community curation and shared values drive discovery.
Visual Concept / Cartoon Scene: A tug-of-war between a robot labeled "Algorithm" and a group of people labeled "Community," with a treasure chest of "Valuable Content" in the middle.
