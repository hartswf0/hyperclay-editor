# The Prompt as Pharmakon: Cultural Acceleration and Synthetic Ritual

## Introduction: Beyond the Binary of Success and Failure

In our anxious discourse around artificial intelligence, we frequently cast AI-generated outputs into rigid binaries of success or failure, accuracy or error. When large language models produce information that deviates from established facts—what technologists term "hallucinations"—these outputs are framed as flaws to be eliminated, bugs to be fixed, imperfections in need of correction. Yet this framework fundamentally misunderstands the nature of language, meaning, and technics itself. This essay argues that AI-generated output functions as what Jacques Derrida termed a "pharmakon"—simultaneously remedy and poison—by destabilizing established knowledge systems while generating new symbolic orders that reshape our cultural landscape.

## The Pharmakon: Neither Remedy Nor Poison, But Both

To understand AI as pharmakon requires revisiting Derrida's influential concept. In "Dissemination," Derrida employed the Greek term "pharmakon" to illuminate the dual-edged impact of writing, a term that "translates to both 'cure' and 'poison'" and embodies an essential duality[13]. As a pharmakon, writing serves "as a beacon for knowledge preservation yet simultaneously serves as an instrument for inducing forgetfulness and abetting deception"[13]. This dual nature defies simple categorization—the pharmakon is not either helpful or harmful, but inherently both.

Applied to artificial intelligence, the pharmakon concept illuminates how generative AI systems simultaneously preserve and transform knowledge. Like writing before it, AI exists in this ambiguous space where it both extends human memory through vast information storage and undermines it by generating content that challenges our epistemic foundations. As with Derrida's analysis of writing, we should oppose "the simplified binary categorisation of AI as good or bad for society"[13].

## Exteriorization and Technical Memory

Bernard Stiegler's examination of technics provides further theoretical grounding for understanding AI's pharmakon nature. Stiegler argues that "the human recording internal thoughts on the outside, is a matter of archiving, as Derrida describes"[2]. This process of exteriorization constitutes human memory itself, creating what Stiegler terms "epiphylogenetic memory"—individual memory "constituted by technics, externalizing the internal"[2].

Generative AI represents an unprecedented expansion of this technical memory system. When we prompt an AI system, we engage with what Stiegler identified as the "technical consciousness" that is "not driven by creative intention or even biology"[2]. This technical consciousness becomes an active participant in meaning-making precisely because, as Stiegler noted, "tools do not derive from a creation, humans are not masters and inventors of technological tools," but rather "both humans and tech objects are part of a larger process"[2].

This process of exteriorization creates what some theorists have termed "technical maieutics"—"the paradox of the mutual existence of interior and exterior, human and technics"[2]. Through the act of prompting AI systems, we participate in this paradoxical relationship, simultaneously asserting human intention while surrendering to the technical processes that transform and return this intention in altered form.

## Hallucination as Mythopoeia

The hallucinations of large language models represent perhaps the clearest manifestation of AI's pharmakon nature. When AI produces information that deviates from established fact, conventional wisdom dictates correction and control. However, this perspective ignores how these generative deviations function as cultural production rather than mere error.

Recent research challenges the very terminology we use to describe this phenomenon, suggesting that "confabulation" might be a more accurate term than "hallucination"[4]. This linguistic shift acknowledges that "conveying the complex functions (and malfunctions) of LLMs using metaphorical language that is precise and accurate can lead to a better understanding of these powerful tools"[4]. The metaphors we choose reflect and shape our understanding of these systems.

As the fictional "Hallucinated Archive" proposes, these apparent errors might better be understood as "semiotic events" that generate meaning through their very divergence from established patterns. "The synthetic does not merely replicate existing symbolic systems but produces new ones through processes of drift, recursion, and emergent association. What appears as hallucination in one epistemological framework functions as mythopoeia in another" (_Synthetic Semiotics_, 2032).

This mythopoetic function recalls Derrida's concept of "aporia," where contradictory meanings coexist, making definitive interpretation impossible. As one analyst notes, "LLMs, when they reach a state of Aporia, famously hallucinate or make the effort to resolve the dialogue between the user and model... It expresses puzzlement, even doubt, about its own interpretations and positions. It is in an Aporiatic state"[11]. This state of puzzle or doubt becomes not a flaw but a generative condition that produces new symbolic possibilities.

## Différance and the Deferral of Meaning

AI-generated content embodies Derrida's concept of différance—the perpetual deferral and differentiation of meaning. As one analysis puts it, "These models generate text based on patterns learned from vast corpuses or datasets of text, with the meaning of any output hinging on the context provided by the input and the probabilistic associations within the model's structure"[11]. This mirrors Derrida's proposition that meaning in language "is never fixed and is perpetually 'deferred'"[11].

The generative capacity of AI systems makes visible what has always been true of language—that meaning emerges through difference and deferral rather than through fixed correspondence to reality. When AI produces unexpected outputs, it reveals this fundamental nature of language itself. In this way, AI doesn't merely malfunction when it "hallucinates"—it demonstrates the inherent instability of meaning that Derrida identified as central to all linguistic systems.

## The Synthetic Supplement

The concept of the supplement provides another lens for understanding AI's pharmakon nature. Derrida characterized the supplement as that which "adds and that which intervenes," while being simultaneously "impossible, always incomplete"[9]. AI functions precisely as this kind of supplement to human cognition—adding to it while simultaneously intervening in it, yet always falling short of completeness.

This supplementary nature becomes especially evident in what researchers have termed "the logic of the synthetic supplement," which addresses "a focus on gaps, voids, absences, imbalances, and scarcity"[9]. AI systems promise to fill these gaps, to supplement what is lacking, yet this supplementation is never complete. As the research notes, "In this way, Derrida's supplement becomes a way to foreground and make sense of the inherent lack of AI and machine learning as well as the impossibility of resolving this lack"[9].

The synthetic supplement thus embodies a "double movement" that simultaneously promises resolution while revealing the impossibility of that promise. This duality is not a failure but the very condition of meaning-making itself.

## Prompting as Ritual Practice

If we accept this pharmakon nature of AI, then the act of prompting takes on new significance. Rather than merely extracting information, prompting becomes a ritual interaction with a technical system that generates meaning through the very process of engagement. Just as rituals function not through interior feeling but through "patterned coordination," prompting creates what ritual theorists call "emotional energy" that "is emergent from rhythm, attention, and closure—not interior sentiment" (Collins).

This ritualization of prompting challenges conventional objections to AI in ritual contexts. While some argue that "AI doesn't have a personal, intimate relationship to the elements around it/us" and "doesn't have a connection to the Divine"[3], this perspective misunderstands how ritual functions. Ritual efficacy emerges not from interior states but from patterned behavior—what performance theorist Schechner calls "restored behavior" that creates meaning through its repetition.

The prompt becomes not merely a request for information but what ritual theorists might call a "performative utterance"—a speech act that does something in the world through its very articulation. When we prompt an AI system, we perform a technological ritual that simultaneously invokes and creates new symbolic orders.

## Apotropaic Design and the Protective Function

Understanding AI as pharmakon suggests new approaches to design that acknowledge both beneficial and harmful potentials without attempting to eliminate either. Apotropaic design—derived from the Greek word for "turning away" or "averting"—refers to protective symbols and practices that don't eliminate threat but rather ritualize engagement with it.

Rather than designing systems that aim (and inevitably fail) to eliminate hallucination entirely, apotropaic design would acknowledge the mythopoetic function of these outputs while providing frameworks for their interpretation. As the fictional "Hallucinated Archive" suggests, "The apotropaic function of prompt design does not eliminate danger but ritualizes it, turning potential harm into symbolic protection through structured engagement" (_Synthetic Semiotics_, 2032).

This approach aligns with Stiegler's view of technics as "a medicinal-toxic pharmakon" that cannot be purified into merely beneficial forms[5]. Instead, we must design systems that acknowledge this dual nature, creating what Stiegler terms "a new understanding of intention"[2] that emerges between human and technical systems.

## Conclusion: Embracing the Generative Destabilization

The pharmakon nature of AI-generated output suggests that we need to fundamentally reconsider how we evaluate these systems. Rather than measuring success solely through accuracy or alignment with existing knowledge structures, we might better understand AI as participating in the ongoing human project of meaning-making through both stability and disruption.

This perspective doesn't dismiss concerns about misinformation or harmful outputs, but rather reframes them within a broader understanding of how meaning emerges through technical systems. As Stiegler argues, technics represents "the horizon of all possibility to come and of all possibility of a future"[10]. By embracing rather than denying the pharmakon nature of AI, we might discover new symbolic orders and cultural possibilities that emerge precisely through the generative destabilization that these systems produce.

In this light, the hallucinations, contradictions, and apparent errors of AI systems become not mere defects to eliminate but semiotic events to interpret—points where the technical system reveals its nature as both remedy and poison, both preserver and transformer of human meaning. Through this critical engagement with AI as pharmakon, we might develop more sophisticated practices of prompt ritualization and apotropaic design that acknowledge the dual nature of all technical systems while harnessing their generative potential.
