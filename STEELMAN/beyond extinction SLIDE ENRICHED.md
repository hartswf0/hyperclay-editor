Slide 1: Title Slide
Title: Beyond Extinction: The Existential Crisis of Human Exceptionalism
Subtitle: Rethinking AI Doomerism and Human Identity
Visual Concept / Cartoon Scene: A human silhouette standing at the edge of a cliff labeled "Extinction," but looking back at a shadow labeled "Irrelevance" that looms even larger behind them. In the distance, symbolic AI figures are building their own monuments.

Slide 2: The Psychology of Existential Significance
Thinker / Source: Ernest Becker [Denial of Death]; Mortality Paradox (various existential psychologists)
URL: [Becker] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Denial_of_Death
Key Quote: "Humans are uniquely concerned with symbolic immortality and legacy—what Ernest Becker called our 'denial of death' through cultural meaning systems that outlast our physical existence."
Core Argument / Thesis: The fear of AI is often less about literal extinction and more about losing the frameworks that give human life significance and symbolic immortality.
Example: The anxiety that AI might write more enduring books, compose more lasting music, or shape culture in ways that eclipse human legacy.
Visual Concept / Cartoon Scene: A human carving their name into a stone, while a robot nearby is etching a glowing, ever-expanding digital tapestry.

Slide 3: Cultural Narcissism and the Anthropocentric Frame

Key Quote: "Anthropocentrism functions as what philosopher Dale Jamieson calls 'a kind of species narcissism' that 'places humans at the center of value and attention.'"
Core Argument / Thesis: AI panic is rooted in a challenge to the privileged status of humans as the central meaning-makers—a core assumption of Western philosophy.
Example: The discomfort when AI-generated art is celebrated or when machines outperform humans in creative competitions.
Visual Concept / Cartoon Scene: A museum with a grand hall of human portraits; a new wing is being built by AI robots, filled with abstract, non-human art.

Slide 4: The Competition for Meaning-Making
Thinker / Source: Charles Taylor, Martin Heidegger [Meaning-Making, Self-Interpreting Animals]
URL: [Taylor] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Taylor_(philosopher) | [Heidegger] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Heidegger
Key Quote: "Philosopher Charles Taylor describes humans as 'self-interpreting animals' whose identity depends on frameworks of significance."
Core Argument / Thesis: If AI can generate compelling narratives and frameworks, it challenges the assumption that meaning-making is a uniquely human domain.
Example: AI writing novels, composing symphonies, or generating philosophical arguments that are taken seriously by human audiences.
Visual Concept / Cartoon Scene: A human and an AI sitting at desks, each weaving a tapestry of symbols; the tapestries begin to intertwine.

Slide 5: Post-Anthropocentric Subjectivity
Thinker / Source: Andy Clark, Peter-Paul Verbeek, Donna Haraway [Extended Mind, Posthuman Condition, Response-Ability]
URL: [Clark] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Clark | [Verbeek] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter-Paul_Verbeek | [Haraway] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donna_Haraway
Key Quote: "The challenge isn't preserving human uniqueness but developing what philosopher Donna Haraway calls 'response-ability'—the capacity to engage ethically with multiple forms of agency."
Core Argument / Thesis: Human cognition is already extended and entangled with technology; the future lies in ethical engagement with diverse intelligences, not in defending a static human essence.
Example: Collaborative projects where humans and AI co-create art, science, or policy, each contributing unique strengths.
Visual Concept / Cartoon Scene: A network of humans and AI entities exchanging glowing threads, forming a web labeled "Cognitive Ecology."

Slide 6: AI Risk as Secular Theology
Thinker / Source: Beth Singler, Paul Tillich [AI Narratives, Ultimate Concern]
URL: [Singler] https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/ai-narratives-mirror-religious-stories | [Tillich] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Tillich
Key Quote: "Contemporary AI narratives often follow 'redemption, apocalypse, and revelation' patterns that mirror religious frameworks."
Core Argument / Thesis: AI risk discourse often echoes theological concerns, positioning humans as both insignificant and ultimately responsible for shaping superintelligent values.
Example: The mythic framing of AI as either savior or destroyer, and the moral imperative to "align" AI with human values.
Visual Concept / Cartoon Scene: A stained-glass window depicting a human and an AI negotiating over the controls of a cosmic machine.

Slide 7: Implications and Alternative Framings
Thinker / Source: Peter-Paul Verbeek, Donna Haraway (Posthumanism, Response-Ability)
URL: [Verbeek] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter-Paul_Verbeek | [Haraway] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donna_Haraway
Key Quote: "The Gremlin Take suggests we need new conceptual frameworks for relating to artificial intelligence beyond either uncritical embrace or existential panic."
Core Argument / Thesis: Rather than focusing on extinction, we should explore how multiple forms of intelligence can coexist, co-create meaning, and evolve new ethical frameworks.
Example: Designing AI systems that facilitate mutual learning and creative exchange between humans and machines.
Visual Concept / Cartoon Scene: A roundtable where humans, AIs, and symbolic animal figures are engaged in collaborative drawing and debate.

Slide 8: Conclusion
Summary Points:
- Fear of AI is often a fear of irrelevance, not just extinction.
- The challenge is to rethink human value and meaning in a world of multiple intelligences.
- Post-anthropocentric ethics require "response-ability" and creative coexistence.
Visual Concept / Cartoon Scene: The human from Slide 1, now standing in a vibrant, multi-species agora, exchanging ideas and symbols with humans, AIs, and other entities, the cliff of "Extinction" now behind them.
