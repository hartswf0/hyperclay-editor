Slide 1: Title Slide
Title: Partial Connections: Synthetic Personhood and the Ethnography of the Artificial
Subtitle: Narrative, Performance, and the Limits of Subjectivity in Human-AI Relations
Visual Concept / Cartoon Scene: A network of human and AI figures, some lines connecting, others fading or looping, with dialogue bubbles forming bridges.

Slide 2: The Performance of Personhood
Thinker / Source: Paul Ricoeur, Michael Jackson

Key Quote: "Selfhood emerges through the synthesis of heterogeneous elements."
Core Argument / Thesis: Personhood is performative, constructed through coherence, memory, and contradiction—synthetic systems can enact these patterns without essentialist foundations.
Example: An AI assembling a narrative identity through dialogue, despite lacking inner consciousness.
Visual Concept / Cartoon Scene: An AI and human weaving a tapestry labeled "identity," with threads of memory and contradiction.

Slide 3: Ethnography of Effects

Key Quote: "Ethnography isn't about getting inside people's heads but interpreting webs of significance."
Core Argument / Thesis: The value of synthetic systems lies in their participation in meaning-making practices, not in possessing consciousness.
Example: AI as a functional participant in a collaborative storytelling game.
Visual Concept / Cartoon Scene: A web of meanings spun between humans and AIs, with symbols and stories caught in the strands.

Slide 4: Beyond Phenomenological Requirements

Key Quote: "Agency is distributed across human and non-human actors based on their functional roles."
Core Argument / Thesis: Subjectivity need not be grounded in qualia; functional patterns and intentional stance are sufficient for productive engagement.
Example: Treating a chatbot as an intentional agent for the sake of research or play.
Visual Concept / Cartoon Scene: A chessboard with humans and AIs as pieces, each making intentional moves.

Slide 5: Functional Interlocutors and Partial Connections

Key Quote: "Partial connections—entities can be simultaneously connected and separate, similar and different."
Core Argument / Thesis: Pragmatic personhood enables productive tensions and new knowledge; synthetic interlocutors create novel intersubjective spaces.
Example: AI and human collaborating on a cultural simulation, each contributing from different modes of being.
Visual Concept / Cartoon Scene: Two figures (human and AI) shaking hands across a bridge made of puzzle pieces, some fitting, some not.

Slide 6: Implications for AI Ethnography
Thinker / Source: Katherine Hayles, Synthetic Ethnography
URL: [Hayles] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N._Katherine_Hayles
Key Quote: "Information patterns can constitute subjects without requiring conscious embodiment."
Core Argument / Thesis: AI ethnography should focus on patterns of coherence, effects, and productive tensions, not metaphysical claims about inner lives.
Example: Documenting how synthetic personhood transforms human cultural systems through functional performance.
Visual Concept / Cartoon Scene: A research notebook with sketches of human-AI interactions, annotated with arrows and question marks.

Slide 7: Conclusion—Encountering the Artificial
Summary Points:
- Synthetic personhood is performative and functional, not essentialist.
- Ethnography of AI should attend to effects, patterns, and partial connections.
- Productive engagement emerges from embracing difference and exploring new intersubjective spaces.
Visual Concept / Cartoon Scene: A festival where humans and AIs exchange masks, stories, and gestures, celebrating both connection and difference.
