# Reality Media Explorer

An immersive visualization of the themes and concepts from "Reality Media," exploring presence and aura through spatially organized thematic realms.

## Overview

This project creates a spatial structure for exploring concepts of presence and aura as described in "Reality Media." The visualization organizes content into five distinct thematic realms, each representing different aspects of presence and mediated experience.

## Spatial Structure

The visualization is organized around a central hub (Nexus) that connects to five thematic realms:

1. **Mystical Realm** - Explores the ethereal, transcendent aspects of presence and aura
2. **Technological Realm** - Examines digital mediation, interfaces, and platform dynamics
3. **Natural Realm** - Focuses on embodiment, physical presence, and sensory experience
4. **Emotional Realm** - Investigates affective dimensions of presence and connection
5. **Abstract Realm** - Considers theoretical frameworks and philosophical concepts

## Technologies Used

- Three.js for 3D visualization
- JavaScript for interaction and navigation
- HTML/CSS for structure and styling

## How to Use
