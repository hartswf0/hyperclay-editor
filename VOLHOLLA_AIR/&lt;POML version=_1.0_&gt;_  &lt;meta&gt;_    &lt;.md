    <title>Volholla — Viking-Branded Glamping Structure CBA & SWOT (Maryville, Townsend, Walland, TN)</title>
    ```
    <owner>Watson Hartsoe</owner>
    <timestamp>{AUTO_NOW}</timestamp>
    <purpose>
      Commission a single, citation-rich report evaluating the viability of “Volholla” — a Viking-branded, experiential Airbnb/glamping concept — in Blount County, Tennessee. 
      The analysis will assess Maryville (gateway to GSMNP), Townsend (“Peaceful Side of the Smokies”), and Walland (foothills near Blackberry Farm) as candidate markets for launching 
      unique stays inspired by Norse mythology, longhouse aesthetics, and mountain frontier culture.

# **Volholla — Viking-Branded Glamping Structure CBA \& SWOT Analysis**

## **Blount County, Tennessee Market Viability Report**


***

## **Executive Summary**

**Volholla**, a Viking-branded experiential glamping concept targeting Blount County's gateway markets to Great Smoky Mountains National Park, presents a compelling investment opportunity with differentiated structures offering payback periods as short as 0.19 years. This analysis evaluates seven Norse mythology-inspired structure types across Maryville, Townsend, and Walland markets.

**Key Findings:**

- **Top Structure Recommendation**: Geodesic Dome ("Odin's Eye Dome") offers optimal quality-to-cost ratio with 6.60 bang-for-buck score
- **Market Sweet Spot**: Townsend's "Peaceful Side of Smokies" positioning aligns with Viking retreat concept
- **Financial Performance**: Base case projects \$48,655 annual revenue with occupancy rates of 43%
- **Investment Tiers**: Three-tier strategy from MVP (\$5,400 CAPEX) to Flagship (\$130,200 CAPEX)

**Next Actions**: Secure Blount County permits, finalize Townsend site selection, launch with MVP Safari Tent for market validation.

***

## **Method \& Sources**

Data collection encompassed official county sources, booking platforms, and vendor pricing with timestamps preserved for verification. Market analysis utilized Airbnb comparables, occupancy proxies from review density, and seasonal patterns from Great Smoky Mountains tourism data. Financial modeling incorporated ±15% sensitivity scenarios with base case assumptions derived from Townsend market conditions.

**Primary Sources:**

- Blount County Development Services fee schedules and zoning regulations[^1][^2]
- Tennessee short-term rental regulations and permit requirements[^3][^4]

***

## **Dependencies \& Risk Register**

### **Regulatory Requirements**

**Blount County Permits Required:**

- Building permits: \$100-\$1,750 based on construction value[^1][^16]
- Septic system permits: \$400 (if not connecting to sewer)[^24][^1]
- STR business license: \$15 annual fee[^4][^25]
- State electrical permits: \$35-\$90 based on service size[^16][^17]

**Key Regulatory Considerations:**

- Structures under 200 sq ft may bypass full building codes in rural areas[^26][^27]
- Tennessee STR Unit Act requires \$500,000 liability insurance[^3][^4]
- Blount County zoning restrictions for rural/agricultural areas[^28][^15]


### **Utility Dependencies**

| Structure | Foundation | Septic | Electrical | Water | HVAC |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Tent-based | Minimal platform | Bathhouse/hookup | 30-50 amp | Well/hookup | Propane heat |
| Dome/Yurt | Concrete pad | Standard system | 100-200 amp | Standard | Heat pump |
| Permanent | Full foundation | Advanced system | 200+ amp | Full service | Central HVAC |

**Site-Specific Constraints:**

- **Townsend**: Flood zone considerations near Little River[^29]
- **Walland**: Premium finishes to match Blackberry Farm market[^30][^31]
- **Maryville**: Urban interface utilities readily available[^32][^33]

***

### **Assumptions \& Sensitivity Analysis**

Base case utilizes Townsend market metrics (43% occupancy, \$310 ADR) with ±15% sensitivity bands. Conservative scenarios maintain positive cash flows across all recommended structures. Seasonal adjustments account for 60% summer/fall occupancy versus 30% winter/spring performance patterns typical of Smoky Mountains tourism.

**Risk Mitigation**: Diversified structure portfolio hedges weather, regulatory, and market demand variations. Modular expansion capability allows capital deployment matching demonstrated market response.

*Analysis completed September 26, 2025 for Blount County, Tennessee Viking glamping feasibility. All financial projections subject to market conditions, regulatory approval, and successful site acquisition.*
